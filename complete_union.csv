one chip shortage youve heard lot many different company industry second manufacturing disruption southeast asia second covid disruption improved materially across october currently quarter think primary cause shortage chip shortage affect affecting say pretty much product currently demand point view demand robust part demand also strong believe time finish quarter constraint larger billion experienced shannon cross okay great youll sort push forward next quarter well different question im curious youre starting sell thing ratable basis thinking mean new mac keep seeing buy monthly charge think thats driving sale think percent maybe portfolio thats available dont know want tell u much revenue recurring nature definitely seems youre shifting maybe sort bundled sale offering consumer standpoint pay one price every month get device service thank tim cook yes first product shannon really sold monthly basis iphone began happen example shortly subsidy kind world changed markedly would say predominantly mode buying iphone united state monthly kind plan today balance product still popular would buying outright seeing demand monthly payment want give customer want see u thing like meet customer provide price want way want pay dont know percentage product sold way today increasing operator hear next amit daryanani evercore amit daryanani perfect thanks lot good afternoon everyone two well guess think supply chain headwind youre talking billion september getting bigger december tim would love understand guy comfort really demand thats getting deferred versus potentially getting destroyed least somewhere else think supply chain bottleneck coo managed lot stuff feel comfortable sort peak december alleviates trajectory look like improvement tim cook yes feel comfortable feel like weve made great progress disruption happened across month october materially better position today difficult predict covid im going predict go tell today materially better position september first several week october term chip shortage chip shortage happening legacy node primarily buy leading edge node issue leading edge node legacy node compete many different company supply difficult forecast thing balance youd know kind economy going accuracy everyone el demand projection dont feel comfortable making prediction think would subject much inaccuracy feel comfortable operational team think weve got one im sure theyre everything collapse cycle time improve yield thing addition fundamental capacity investment remedy situation amit daryanani got luca may ask question gross margin december youre essentially guiding gross margin flat maybe little bit versus sort september maybe touch think historically would expected gross margin december given much revenue leverage end maybe put take gross margin resulting flattish guide versus historical seasonality luca maestro well know typically obviously december holiday season get leverage say also period year launch lot new product know launch essentially every product category launch new product demand strong know launch new product tend higher cost structure beginning cycle thats balance obviously standpoint actually significant expansion right look year ago december quarter clearly indicates significant expansion operator well hear next katy huberty morgan stanley katy huberty thank given supply chain blurring demand picture iphone data point share help investor understand whether demand tracking product cycle flat growing strong iphone maybe front luca also comment exited quarter channel inventory standpoint iphone relative normal product cycle ive got tim cook yes look maybe take channel inventory would expect constrained environment iphone channel inventory ended targeted range currently thats term blurring demand look katy look number different data point look demand across online store demand retail look back order carrier channel one take back order look channel order well number different data point use conclude strong demand feel good demand right working feverishly supply side katy huberty tim recently surveyed consumer china feedback dont want pay apps service direct

next question david vogt ubs david vogt great thank guy two quick question one big picture theoretical covered supply chain pretty extensive detail call maybe bigger picture youre thinking philosophically given sort went last month mean sort recalibration needed adjustment around supply chain philosophy either partner perspective maybe regional perspective think current infrastructure ability sort rebound sort handle sort disruption seem crop time time tim cook yes dont see fundamental error weve made thats youre picking term creating environment created number reason pandemic came along people industry people outside industry thought pandemic would reduce demand pulled order thing reset really happened demand went went even straight trend would predict industry working im making little overly simplistic there thing like yield thing like happening well thing mainly manageable course time working partner making sure supply need making sure demand statement accurate see forth time reducing lead time cycle time get chip fab quickly possible product shipping also helping fab partner increase yield thing thing also support chip act investment put investment ground spending time advocating chip act well david vogt great thats helpful didnt mean implicate guy messed maybe came way maybe quick think purchasing device ratably touched earlier maybe touch partnership carrier support given last couple year key component success tight relationship globally think sort business model currently sort put together globally sort permanent structure meaning carrier going integral part driving demand iphones sense maybe little bit transitory depending part cycle tim cook think provided decade kind upgrade potential multiyear kind thing one year done think motivated carrier motivated mutual interest customer benefit hugely getting new phone number feature think everybody aligned purpose model paint wouldnt call global model different variation around world depending upon country general think marriage partnership carrier channel never stronger solid footing operator well take next question krish sankar cowen company krish sankar two tim give reprieve

consolidation seeing service side industry thanks lot bob bradway nothing new terence said remark continuing look way use balance sheet strengthen business continuing look way invest innovation weve made think point topic well known wouldnt say there change course last quarter operator next question line christopher raymond piper jaffray christopher raymond hi thanks guy one question enbrel kind struck tony prepared comment know talked last quarter would represent think said annual number full year math think would infer enbrel revenue billion full year know guy dont want give guidance granular youve already given number lot bigger consensus actually imply number would seem reversal saw want could verify first math right maybe sort talk driver term trend reversal thanks tony hooper yes let confirm quarter one normally low quarter need need reset deductible patient pick second quarter said last quarter expected quarter total annual revenue probably landed almost expect full year number dont get high christopher raymond got thank operator next question line ying huang bank america merrill lynch ying huang hi thanks taking question wondering maybe tony comment recent icer draft analysis cost benefit aimovig actually propose wrench pricing would actually take consideration price aimovig thanks tony hooper ying couple thing one draft publication icer requesting public comment including think may number organization busy commenting second publication obviously remember already one publication took place march journal medical economics authored number headache specialist economist laid clear value range particular category icer report doesnt seem take account thing absenteeism presenteeism would argue really important thing look employee perspective employer perspective range within reasonable level discussing payer operator next question line alethia young credit suisse alethia young hey guy thanks taking question question amg curious there kind particular preclinical work suggests opportunity favor maybe lupus ra gvhd kind still open question also possibility le frequent dosing sean harper extended kind construct weve designed think course preclinical model disease would say youre working different mechanism ever applied autoimmune disease faith predictive nature animal model disease like lupus ra modest use kind scientific reasoning animal model guide u kind initial set experiment chose fair say like case example tnf inhibitor came available ultimately important screened human disease determine whether mechanism fruitful operator next question line robyn karnauskas citi unidentified analyst hi kripa robyn like mentioned earlier youre developing therapy multiple mode bite target indication lot pipeline wondering take u thought process decide target indication two different modality decide go one direction versus sean harper right good question mean first thing would point moment moving clinic really deliberately matched couple bite could actually scientifically determine pro con technology data exists today much apple orange term patient population way theyve example treated let say cell versus blincyto even get disease surface example various form positive lymphoma dont want give get impression lot lot target double program helpful designed specifically hopefully human give u understanding whether benefit risk look better one hyper technology versus another thats kind approach like understand hematologic solid tumor setting ultimately determine move forward primarily oncology going efficacy right acceptable amount safety really dont know yet whether get generally similar kind clinical benefit example bite intervention versus car would hard imagine would select car circumstance given lot consider practical consideration cost good thing sort early day dont think anyone ever really made comparison lot speculation hoping shed actual light clinical question operator next question line geoffrey porges leerink partner geoffrey porges thanks much taking question sean list milestone still romosozumab regulatory submission european review could give u update expectation labeled indication sort size addressable patient population romosozumab sean harper sure yes think romo point well process discovering entire clinical data base experience molecule make sure every cardiovascular event may occurred trial run new blinded adjudication process well make sound easy actually quite time consuming requires coordination u another clinical center case timmy thats underway think result going important determining end product obviously unmet need kind anabolic product strong compelling need efficacy favorable short period treatment one year think really need understand believe actually cardiovascular risk know geoff two study cant true one say there risk one say get additional information reanalysis could tip scale one direction seeking truth whatever truth make way label little bit hard know benefit risk land whether well talking patient population particularly significant level unmet need therefore make sense use context actually believe there cardiovascular risk versus cardiovascular risk seems much le true phenomenon thats best characterize moment operator next question line michael yee jefferies michael yee hi thanks question question bob mean guess large deal space last week guess important big picture view environment given many deal feel case finding thing good fit price issue guess maybe could talk overall dynamic looking different biotech company thanks much bob bradway think track record pretty disciplined way evaluate target focus confident pathway shareholder earn return looking way invest industry interested innovation aligns well six therapeutic area focus opportunity consistent desired advance innovation globally think mike historically evolution challenged sector see little bit adjustment taking place well continue thoughtful reviewing different opportunity think help u earn return shareholder help make difference patient operator next question line eric schmidt cowen company eric schmidt hey congrats great start maybe question tony repatha since presentation odyssey data seen change market share change pricing discussion payer thank tony hooper eric saw increase nbrxs outcome data came repathas label since acc weve seen relatively little change marketplace date operator next question line umer raffat evercore isi umer raffat hi thanks much taking question bob question there lot investor feedback possible merger equal like transformative deal big pharma name european pharma name particular feel transformative situation something youre open philosophically focus really smith biotech bob bradway focus somewhere finding opportunity invest innovation think make difference innovation focused area important u opportunity enable u continue expand global footprint think speculation rise fall time industry focus thing consistent determination pathway earn return shareholder business development activity operator next question line cory kasimov jpmorgan cory kasimov hey good afternoon thanks taking question wanted ask cgrp recognizing competitive nature class article morning commenting express script intention push lower list price cgrp class limit pocket cost borne patient implement pay performance type model would say consistent interaction youve payer maybe youre thinking different pricing model class following heel unconventional pricing scheme youve implemented thanks tony hooper cory let start one ill let sean talk differentiation product others trying come market clearly lead said coming market first important allows u set baseline price look carefully value based pricing come forward weve listened affordability question marketplace esi looking value based price look forward opening access situation allow access appropriate patient continue come forward price responsible take account requirement best number risk based contract table repatha weve acquired pay talk player risk based complex aimovig let ask sean talk little think drug actually different others coming market sean harper well tony think there number thing point term advantage besides first market first receptor antagonist still case receptor antagonist clinic chose path number reason one potency seem product doesnt require loading dos intravenous administration quite awkward thing patient provider general recently developed data presented today population highly refractory patient failed many four prior prophylactic therapy data looked really strong group thats differentiated data set think also remember physician dealing patient encratic either adverse reaction lack presence efficacy choose different agent within class generally speaking physician started example one ligand sequestering antibody going another ligand sequestering antibody doesnt make whole lot sense compared trying receptor antagonist hope receptor u receptor antagonist would result therapeutic sort option physician trying manage challenging condition operator next question line carter gould ubs equity carter gould afternoon guy thanks taking question guess commercial question tony xgeva hoping get little bit detail uptick quarter could maybe provide rough detail size buy end versus much driven myeloma provided anecdote physician institution maybe commentary access going simplification thank tony hooper okay carter great indication expand label estimate there one hundred thousand multiple myeloma patient potentially could benefit product part b product dont see prescription tightly part product tend look back six eight week arrears clear there large number patient could benefit feedback good buy end probably account million quarter expect burn quite quickly everything weve heard date positive operator next question line matthew harrison morgan stanley matthew harrison great good afternoon thanks taking question wanted ask question parsabiv could understand financial sort growth prospect next year two product outside bundle maybe could talk u happened product think potentially growth driver get added bundle scenario thank bob bradway would tough calculate know dapple run minimum two year cm full evaluation benefit drug weve looked head head trial feel fairly beneficial efficacy perspective also believe ppi line administration dialysis adherence improve definition real world situation deliver higher level value patient dialysis unit therefore really evaluating benefit drug brings calculated future bundle going forward post dapple operator next question line kennen mackay rbc capital market kennen mackay thanks taking question maybe another one tony wondering could elaborate going aranesp surrounding competition smaller provider guidance wondering youre accounting hif inhibitor coming year thank tony hooper okay aranesp know bifurcated whole lot piece half business outside united state business continues fairly stable foreign exchange inside divided dialysis nephrology business hospital nephrology business oncology area oncology declining time see change nephrology dialysis movement competitor long acting competitor fmc moved ido mdos decline seeing volume shape contract people continue fight account account nephrology hospital there strange compare versus first quarter included large clinical trial purchased competitor operator next question line ronny gal bernstein ronny gal hi everybody thanks squeezing tony im afraid one around think contract try sign payer guy looking open access looking close card single word competitor interested youre following second kind mentioned issue around low one need go ldlc wondering sean comment gem article showing kind like feeding benefit start patient ldlc tony hooper think weve always said would always want situation physician choice behalf patient would always advocate open formerly talk consistently looking way mean access high risk patient population there million patient high risk population think small percentage single digit penetration made population date ill let sean talk scientific discussion around lowering ldl sean harper yes im familiar gem article referring published id point accompanying editorial thought pretty good outlining likely confounding occurred problem go back time plus year look mortality theyre confounded case fatality rate occur people hospitalized study experienced heart attack stroke example go back example study western scotland study case fatality rate heart attack back day like really end confounded analysis say well gee start high ldl lower kind mid range get big benefit mortality well thats back statin people came high ldl level got reduced nowadays come much lower ldl level virtually impossible demonstrate statistically significant reduction mortality happened long time lowering trial think confounded think editorial speaks also talk shouldnt pay attention biology understanding holistically product work data emerged study happened field whether statin product like ezetimibe inhibitor overall clear picture matter ldl start lower substantially patient who high risk youre going really going get large risk reduction true patient start high ldl higher risk ldl risk factor absolute term get little bit benefit treating patient higher ldl relative risk reduction appears consistent across trend highest quality data show clear picture lower better without safety concern thats comment tony hooper going past pm east coast dont take two last question bob make closing comment operator certainly next question line salim syed mizuho security salim syed yes hi great guy thanks question one repatha there acc treatment guideline people expected come year acc conference thats november believe view expect expect come term practical incremental revenue opportunity repatha lower target ldl level thank bob bradway comment think youre right sort general expectation around eha time frame point one assumes theyre going waiting around another data set think look lowering land think pretty likely theyll come think look pathway update done month ago likely kind indicative directionally theyre likely go data accumulated tony hooper revenue perspective would imagine would difficult payer utilization management criterion defer guideline published ha acc operator next question james birchenough well fargo security unidentified analyst good afternoon thanks squeezing u

next question line matthew harrison morgan stanley matthew line open matthew harrison great good evening thanks taking question wanted ask question around stocking dynamic quarter know called couple item thought benefit covid could maybe put context obviously normally first quarter see lot destocking across product line see typical destocking could also potential benefit going come year maybe could comment thanks murdo gordon yes hi matthew murdo yes mentioned saw million stocking inventory build say first quarter happened across market element would maybe compare contrast company reporting business given predominantly specialty biologics know fair amount physician administration product necessarily extent early prescription fill patient fill would additional pull forward company reported blended dynamic end customer wholesale inventory build million refers end customer wholesaler inventory specifically product like otezla may pull forward early fill maybe script wait see work operator next question line robyn karnauskas suntrust robinson robyn line open robyn karnauskas hi guy thank much great work running business time take broader step back question know focused lot specific question guy lot experience financial crisis people switching commercial payer medicare government payer help u think managed get people quickly switch manage impact secondly telemedicine comfortable prescribers writing evenity think telemedicine really impact business know new one thank bob bradway robyn murdo answer let make sure heard said comfortable writing doctor writing say evenity prescription telemedicine robyn karnauskas yes yes like telemedicine aspect new u trying understand impact business obviously many product could prescribed telemedicine two aspect would great murdo gordon right yes robyn could clarify first part question question related opening government access like done last little transition people potentially commercial government benefit robyn karnauskas really transition lot people asking transition given potential lot people work going transition plan one company probably tell u manage run business think impact might murdo gordon okay helpful thanks clarification let start topic first overall medicaid portion business right quite low le total revenue majority product beyond reimbursed medicare part b total business reimbursed commercial commercial piece rightly point likely portion likely transition government channel thing harder predict rate people become unemployed important distinction furloughed retain benefit period time opt cobra furloughed employee often still company employee plan sponsored plan time lag going occur people transition either state exchange medicaid benefit think impact could delayed one like towards end year course trying pin actual number american going end unemployment benefit hard peg right two thing total bolus rate change heard commentary read thing would appear indicate people expect earlier perspective patient people transition time likely delay effect telemedicine would say variety maturity high telemedicine used therapeutic area think mental health would argue even neurology telemedicine already used quite extensively even would say uptake telemedicine evaluating someone like migraine patient going relatively straightforward would perhaps dermatology patient case neurology migraine would aimovig dermatology would otezla mentioned evenity course evenity primarily prescribed post fracture patient likely clinic hospital setting ability physician evaluate patient prescribe evenity probably pretty straightforward related acute event watching closely actually aimovig brand telemedicine already used fairly extensively experience go back year scaling experience think front foot come building capability area operator next question line ronny gal bernstein ronny line open ronny gal hi good evening let add thanks dave work two may first david expanded work couple time started patient patient given originally little bit skeptical looking way leverage protocol mean ability bring product market timing murdo done fabulously well count million quarter pfizer coming united state taken bit extra price decrease expectation rest year also mention guy remicade biosimilar kind interesting product dave reese well thanks ronnie dave start question amg continue develop amg primarily combination partner pipeline agent phase umbrella study added cohort study additional indication tumor question well described sensitivity limit need hope data future trial ultimately think probably need order give take monotherapy patient support standard safety package amg put together expansion phase trial allowed u efficient way generate appropriate data murdo gordon yes come biosimilars business pleased run rate million quarter would say would attribute success first foremost reputation biologics manufacturer think something differentiates u perceived well customer experience europe positive one applied lesson learned launch two oncology biosimilars think show biosimilars market functioning well united state would also say biosimilar business model much integrated innovative product people defending neulasta account manager defending neulasta making sure benefit onpro understood customer people establishing uptake curve mvasi kanjinti account relationship cultivated many many year oncology extremely valuable relationship level think helped u extend trajectory nicely would also say patient service exemplary patient service product like kyprolis xgeva apply biosimilars business well mentioned think avsola remicade biosimilar intend launch year product help strengthen already strong immunotherapy portfolio u help u broaden customer perspective product integrated innovative autoimmune portfolio bob bradway ian let take next question getting getting late east coast ask everybody please limit one question ian let go next one operator certainly next one line evan seigerman credit suisse evan line open evan seigerman hi guy thank much taking question kind talking murdo pandemic impact uptick biosimilars seen acceleration adoption save cost center really delayed uptake given potentially overwhelmed system thank murdo gordon bit early tell take comment week experience would say far seen negative effect

michael schmidt guggenheim michael line open michael schmidt hi guy good evening thanks taking question question biosimilar business going really well wondering see sort biosimilar market mature see potentially product launch within market guess view price erosion relative brand think potential floor relative manufacturing development cost biosimilar area thank murdo gordon yes thanks michael one thing mentioned earlier response question biosimilars experience knowing make biologics scale efficient way really good margin business think going experience europe would argue price degradation probably faster even multiple competitor able compete effectively volume able retain profitable business obviously lot analog understand rate change going hold back speculating future hold clear thing competitor compressed early phase biosimilar launch path likely precipitous price erosion fortunate early mvasi kanjinti able establish strong foothold market also repeat said earlier think biosimilar market alive well functioning would hope free market would operator next question line carter gould barclays carter line open carter gould thanks fitting guess maybe bigger picture question around

particular oral option available setting thanks murdo gordon thanks question chris yes overall reflect huge unmet need migraine barely penetrating roughly million incident patient population significant amount usage older medication provide migraine relief aimovig far pleased evolution penetrating unmet need aimovig definitely pleased impact patient life seeing far oral agent really used treatment option given current indication think actually helping strengthen aimovig perception clinical experience patient neurologist interesting see data look like prevention side labeling look like well overall think lot room patient benefit cgrp based therapy think got one best best given convenient month injection really strong coverage across term insured benefit great patient support programming help patient possibly even titrate dosing aimovig think lot lot growth yet realized even additional entrant market chris raymond thank much dave reese yes chris dave would add obviously looking safety small molecule get chronic administration happy safety profile extending year patient aimovig operator next question ronny gal bernstein ronny gal good morning question david first mind clarifying kind mentioned tezepelumab data atopic dermatitis mentioned safety side phase ii asthma see case julian bar guess stroke always concern anaphylaxis population wondering could clarify seeing signal repeating atopic dermatitis trial neutralizing antibody strategy strategy find antibody complementary spike protein coming instead previous strategy look high specificity antibody addition additional strategy dave reese yes thanks ronny regard teze ph data would say concerning safety signal phase ii atopic dermatitis trial phase iii trial standard independent data monitoring committee course periodically evaluate safety always indicated trial proceed planned fully expect happen completion coming month term therapeutic antibody strategy looked rapid evolution field antibody sure aware gone clinic target rbd receptor binding domain spike protein technical assessment antibody appear quite good belief could potentially add value therapeutic armamentarium developing antibody targeting another epitope could potentially added antibody cocktail first generation strategy open start focusing would say watch evolution field ronny gal care share u whose antibody particularly impressed dave reese going comment one leave ass arvind sood erika let take next question operator next question matthew harrison morgan stanley matthew harrison great good afternoon thanks taking question dave hoping ask mutein program seems like made decision move ahead ra obviously gi indication company studying talk little bit excitement lack thereof around indication data got ra may influence profile indication thanks dave reese yes matt thanks question know remain quite interested molecule remind everyone designed enhance number function regulatory cell restore dysregulation occurs certain autoimmune disease knew start high bar rheumatoid arthritis giving existing therapy based emerging data elected go forward indication think variety autoimmune disease interest continuing push program forward move towards additional trial course share got ongoing study disease like lupus remains significant unmet medical need operator next question michael yee jefferies michael yee hey thanks question question david omecamtiv mecarbil course big phase iii readout unique mechanism allergan science could put context u maybe one two thing specifically like prior data degree confidence given high bar cv outcome study clinical meaningful magnitude benefit maybe talk little bit handicap appreciate dave reese yes thanks mike mentioned novel mechanism action first drug directly affect contractility myocardial cell course one primary dysfunction advanced heart failure obviously priority one thing like molecule addition think phase ii data caught eye fact internal consistency looked across physiologic measure various physiologic outcome measure used heart failure program well various biomarkers see sort internal consistency another thing give confidence would point definitive experiment phase iii trial patient well powered sufficient follow think going know answer utility omecamtiv mecarbil advanced heart failure end year operator next question robyn karnauskas suntrust robyn karnauskas hi thanks taking question love new format guess two quick one trend seeing doctor office far ease reimbursement given economic climate give free drug second question given environment spending back half year exchange new thought update u appetite business development thank murdo gordon okay robyn start start first part question turn bob second part question overall actually pretty pleased seeing particularly latter part second quarter patient accessing reimbursement medication generous program provide given fairly significant expansion repatha aimovig evenity coverage permanent j code really seen le need program currently could change longer term patient maybe currently furloughed could become displaced laid patient may securing cobra could end lapsing also many patient end going benefit spousal benefit multiple layer people losing insurance coverage might able bridge different mechanism also hopeful maybe even optimistic additional stimulus would provided patient seek continuity health care coverage overall would say far good despite significant disruption obviously economy bob bradway business development robyn would point change approach addressed think pretty consistently prior call looking licensing acquisition opportunity area focus continue think particular scouring licensee landscape moment keep posted opportunity develop arvind sood erika let take next question reminder participant please limit one question erika go ahead operator next question geoffrey porges svp leerink geoffrey porges thank thank much taking question congratulation continued business trying circumstance follow question omecamtiv could give u sense well powered study sort hazard ratio aiming achieve statistical significance importantly perhaps sort hazard ratio benefit think clinically significant given quite product advancing setting right dave reese geoff thanks question would say study powered detect would consider clinically meaningful difference outcome primary endpoint standard sort trial composite heart failure event cardiovascular death order improvement measure sort thing cardiologist typically look considered clinically meaningful study designed detect sort difference geoffrey porges great thank operator next question umer raffat evercore isi umer raffat hi thanks much taking question wanted focus kras second maybe gauge expectation durability response would prepare street heading data b could catch u whether early evidence emerging bid dosing seeing possible efficacy differentiation higher auc bid thank bob bradway thanks umer term duration response still early mentioned going update phase data esmo roughly week seen time datasets get look duration bid dosing continue examine would expect going later year first part next year would enough data thoroughly examine safety whether sort efficacy difference monotherapy bid dosing would reiterate based everything seen remain comfortable monotherapy dose chosen go forward term kras inhibition certainly lung cancer primary focus right umer raffat thank operator next question alethia young cantor fitzgerald alethia young hey guy thanks taking question congrats progress quarter another one omecamtiv know roughly million people heart failure reduced injection fraction hoping murdo maybe could drill little bit help u think maybe kind initial population based study designed thanks murdo gordon yes thanks alethia would say dave already touched given slightly sicker population recent heart failure trial focus really institutional setting made investment course last year year expand cardiovascular hospital presence established cardiovascular account management team focus really severe hospital frequent flyer heart failure patient really need symptomatic improvement need functional improvement reduce amount hospitalization also think quite frankly greatest value treating heart failure exist health care system hopefully successful trial hand still see really good opportunity type patient bob bradway would add alethia trial includes initiation therapy hospitalized patient patient murdo mentioned little sicker population trial read recently heart failure typically leading top handful cause hospitalization country almost always leading cause within day huge economic implication murdo mentioned factor really informed thinking drug might positioned going forward operator next question cory kasimov jpmorgan cory kasimov hey good afternoon guy thanks taking question one probably murdo curious anticipate tailwind neulasta onpro might extend beyond given provider may see value product may previously curious able gather feedback field front pandemic murdo gordon thanks cory experienced far mean really two driver tailwind alluded one overall utilization filgrastim general gone course innovation onpro allows patient le frequent visit site care driven share preference onpro think able hold quite bit improvement share also hoping oncologist remain vigilant continue increase usage filgrastim general consistent nccn guideline clearly long covid people using care strategy minimize patient exposure particularly compromised patient exposure risk course onpro minimizing exposure site care may pick infection overall think pretty enthusiastic seeing neulasta onpro specifically cory kasimov okay appreciate operator next question mohit bansal citigroup mohit bansal great thanks taking question congrats progress one quick one aimovig one common feedback get doctor many patient migraine patient get treated physician headache specialist may reason penetration slow agent end see client use cgrp expanding primary care even possible could company like could make possible thank murdo gordon yes thanks mohit experience primary care physician promotion primary care physician target audience specialize treating migraine become good would say openness using aimovig actually quite good quite high think one point would would make adjacent describing definitely saw covid even bottlenecking part neurologist extent headache clinic getting caught patient care period covid disruption think continue watch closely seeing good improvement stretched specialty neurologist take care lot different condition know expand care primary care treatment better think growth category would align observation need expand prescribing population physician cgrp actually see happening data mohit bansal thank operator next question carter gould barclays carter gould thank good afternoon guy question peter hoping could walk cost good progression quarter appreciate guidance quarter mean volume biosimilars meaningfully believe meaningful royalty yet cog strictly sort related ability sort downshift nuance missing speak sort broader cog story thank peter griffith thank carter yes cost good sold product mix first second quarter rather would expect said consistent overall basis year operator next question salim syed mizuho security salim syed great thanks much question guy also throw thanks leader industry shortening prepared remark hopefully others follow suit well one question omecamtiv maybe david david sound like pretty bold trial working heading bogey mentioned want know one thing pick trial design whether sicker patient mentioned maybe slight proponent elevation saw cosmic one reason trial failed hit bogey curious believe reason would dave reese yes thanks salim hard speculate specific reason look advanced heart failure high risk nature fully recognize think done methodologically good trial point molecule mother nature going know answer month salim syed okay right thank operator next question dane leone raymond james dane leone hi thank taking question congrats navigating difficult macro environment one question wanted focus otezla clearly result mild moderate psoriasis setting good building effort go market setting question get actually tackle market drug used specifically mechanistically going open formulary actually really unlock mild patient phenotype versus moderate already penetration guess one label really read differently open two going work payer going change formulary status murdo gordon thanks question dane overall see large population mild moderate patient really focused patient tend larger surface area skin involved psoriasis really finding topical treatment incompatible nature disease looking something better like oral option think given strength result clinical trial feel would able target motivate population patient seek alternative topical treatment much way otezla currently used today post topical pre biologic think really logical expansion current positioning interaction prescribers encouraged enthusiasm otezla may offer individual patient thing would say end last year initiate primary care promotional effort otezla something legacy celgene colleague could done able try actually saw good promotional response ability given scale primary care field force add otezla mix think help grow commercial presence also cross training enbrel field force otezla ensure maximal presence hopefully approved indication distant future respect access mentioned specifically good cost benefit otezla compared particularly biologic option actually got good coverage patient population today mild moderate moderate severe patient population today think able expand without much gross net erosion feeling feeling pretty good growth opportunity pleased otezla performed since integrated portfolio

comment know commented opening remark guess question think moving response rate higher term combination study ongoing relative confidence around study either improving response rate improving durability think ability progress rapidly good sense monotherapy activity compound thanks david reese yes thanks matt certainly combination study important topic moving forward quite briskly think seven cohort open three four coming soon feel testing range indication biologically plausible clinically relevant combination data next year number point goal always combination therapy beyond monotherapy enhance efficacy potentially term response rate also durability cutting avenue tumor resistance escape certainly goal much guided biology look cohort coming think see case operator next question come line yaron werber cowen yaron werber yes great thanks taking question david going maybe keep spot sotorasib data comment heard week competing product well tolerated high dose egfr inhibitor pembro remember correctly esmo think investigator said something along line correct wrong product tolerability addressed dose reduction something along line mind maybe exactly kind correct said secondly tezepelumab understanding way study designed actually incorporating low eosinophil dose one analysis primary endpoint hit mean get broad label thank david reese yes sure let take order term combination one thing would caution everyone let read anything cohort three four patient whether trial anyone else trial moving forward foundation tolerability monotherapy critical thing build combination think put perspective editorial new england journal medicine accompanied publication phase trial week ago refer certainly common combination therapy development oncology look sort dosing scheduling regimen fully intend priority would intend regard analysis tezepelumab yes correct analysis powered geared across entire population also look low eosinophil population supposition correct operator next question come line jay olson oppenheimer jay olson hey congrats quarter thank taking question wanted follow comment around kras competing program featured ph data weekend report qt

use biosimilars new patient switching patient treatment biosimilars well say penetration account level deeper originally anticipated think fairly broad adoption level level course within clinic oncology little different inflammation depending biosimilar whether infused biosimilar whether biosimilar think need watch carefully two analogous would treat business segment example draw comparison one evan seigerman thank much arvind sood april go ahead april operator right next question lien chris raymond piper sandler christopher raymond thanks taking question yes wondering could maybe ask sotorasib take conversation back heard david commentary hope response rate combo think guy also working bid dose memory serf think maybe expecting see something year end least coming month wonder could talk hope respect potential monotherapy bid also topic confirm sotorasib cns activity give u indication one thanks david reese yes thanks chris important question standard new molecule part clinical pharmacology program examine different schedule continue twice daily dosing one thing urge everyone kind go back basic pharmacokinetics think field reason go split dosing well really two reason one need split dosing order achieve target coverage two need split dose tolerability issue sotorasib convinced getting target coverage throughout dosing interval dosing course got nice tolerability daily dosing really think basic pharmacology pharmacokinetics science underlying driven clinical choice term cns penetration mention esmo couple patient one two patient cns metastasis clearly response question small molecule cns response general always due true penetration typically highly disrupted blood brain barrier setting almost always get exposure drug third potential explanation continue explore secondary immune activation could potentially trigger activity central nervous system exploring question explicitly cohort opening patient brain metastasis think next year good sense potential activity central nervous system thank christopher raymond thank operator next question come line geoffrey porges svb leerink please go ahead andrew berens thank question andrew geoff question regarding tezepelumab read out study successful might commercialized given conflict partner standout indication thank robert bradway yes thank jump one obviously transparent partner commercialize tezepelumab say many year experience astrazeneca therapeutic area continue believe outstanding partner worked detail commercialization astrazeneca indeed putting dedicated resource promotion tezepelumab think different sale rep literally market promoting two different product handling many element commercial process example lead market access negotiation relationship astrazeneca lead consumer marketing professional marketing think really put best best together continue lot confidence emphasis partner placing really exciting molecule launch also strategic lifecycle management idea well andrew berens thank operator next question come line ronny gal bernstein ronny gal good afternoon thank taking call done really well biosimilars closing billion run rate billion last year wondering balance next year seeing significant competition coming avastin herceptin biosimilars launching rituximab infliximab dynamic seem potentially tougher going think next month expect kind growth rate asking much separately murdo wondering comment repatha outlook think competition physician office based molecule murdo gordon okay thank overall think biosimilars business said evolved really nicely penetrated quite well look oncology product running share currently avastin biosimilar think see additional competitor come average selling price come reality competition brings related comment earlier efficient marketplace think appreciation though done effective commercial presence people talking account innovative portfolio talking customer biosimilars service normally innovative product available biosimilars includes patient service thing like reimbursement assistance think differentiates u would anticipate u able continue capture good volume albeit price erosion go new year said share total bevacizumab market slightly le trastuzumab market still lot headroom growth think inflammation side dynamic little bit different depending whether product like remicade biosimilar avsola whether looking product like rituxan biosimilar think watch draw parallel expectation overall made big commitment biosimilars continue advance new product clinic market compete effectively across europe competing nicely far transitioning repatha look done think excellent job converting affordable price repatha got access coverage across medicaid commercial seeing really nice volume growth quarter think also seeing nice evolution outside repatha continues gain share product really repatha scratching surface need lot coronary event patient require aggressive lipid lowering therapy light covid actually think repatha unique solution product excellent coverage well demonstrated efficacy safety profile event reduction data label think compared product might require patient travel physician office administration light covid going tougher task another product come feel good feel good growth prospect going forward operator next question come line colin bristow ubs colin bristow good afternoon thanks taking question another one sotorasib curious like data asset current thinking around potential advance early guess first line therapy light strong data seen higher agent patient thanks david reese yes thanks colin great question course typical oncology development program start later line therapy patient much way treatment option certainly moving earlier line therapy part development program move forward would also point important part program later line phase iii trial docetaxel chemotherapy important outside jurisdiction regulatory approval also many jurisdiction reimbursement would also overlook potential global development program another important piece thank operator next question come line mohit bansal citibank mohit bansal great thanks taking question maybe one question tezepelumab asthma data coming important think show benefit low patient case work think partner may interested commercializing product given already product high eos patient may two competing product thank david reese yes well let start hand thing murdo discussed primary endpoint powered across entire population also analysis plan allows look low eosinophil group phase ii data currently best predictor showed relatively comparable efficacy regardless eosinophil status certainly would hope able replicate phase iii term commercialization let ask murdo weigh murdo gordon yes mentioned strategic commitment partner teze supportive constructive helpful worked development plan look beyond commercialization potential lifecycle management idea think strong press astrazeneca continue really think patient benefit development teze would say large market opportunity severe asthma alternative mechanism market good thing think plenty room u launch effectively pretty sure partner astrazeneca see mohit bansal okay thank operator next question come line geoff meacham bank america geoffrey meacham afternoon guy thanks much question murdo feel like ask one lot aimovig think take product really break get growing unit new product look range bound meaningful negotiation renegotiation payer like guy repatha going required think could take thanks murdo gordon yes thanks geoff let narrow reframe question think payer issue think negotiated good access aimovig covered broadly little way utilization management criterion physician request filled well percentage paid patient high high range patient access restriction reducing uptick class really two thing one obvious covid substantially new patient per week covid lot migraine sufferer unfortunately seeking care neurology prescribing specialty others like cardiology recovered nicely quarter neurology still term total prescribing covid impact another think opportunity focused neurologist patient moving quicker older preventative agent try biologic cgrps like aimovig really focus growth seen movement going well still got lot work point got large volume patient million think penetrated patient population really doubt mind move also think way oral cgrps helping promotional effort communication patient awareness building benefit category acute promotion also helping preventive space yes focused think done right thing communication front payer focused patient patient provider patient operator next question come line kennen mackay rbc capital kennen mackay hi thanks taking question congrats quarter wondering hoping rather could set record straight planning omecamtiv mecarbil plan pursue regulatory filing agent gating factor thank david reese thanks kennen take omecamtiv issued topline result got

raffat hi thanks much taking question two may first know lot focus duration response data evolving phase phase ii trial kras question think one step possible setting possibly combination know keytruda regimen duration treatment duration response curious expectation keytruda paired targeted therapy much improvement see realistically would helpful number one also note head colorectal data first half knowing think three response colorectal previously expectation need see constructive colorectal thank david reese yes thanks umer term duration response moving earlier line therapy clear checkpoint inhibitor mean typically going look improvement sort efficacy measure get clinically meaningful range designing program sort target would generally look colorectal cancer mentioned fully enrolled phase ii trial data next year inform potential monotherapy path forward would want see response rate perhaps little better observed monotherapy discussion folk field would say also huge amount emphasis combination therapy enhance response rate course generate duration response mentioned earlier got number combination trial either running launch directed specifically colorectal cancer really looking forward generating data think kind state play right umer raffat thank much operator next question come line alethia young cantor fitzgerald alethia young hey guy thanks taking question congrats quarter progress talk little bit otezla seen light maybe would oral know there kind marketing guess television wanted get outlook price volume next month thanks david reese yes thanks alethia

polyp finally otezla submitted supplemental new drug application fda based phase advance study mild moderate psoriasis positive result advance presented american academy dermatology aad meeting day ago closing id like thank staff continuing deliver patient robert bradway okay erica thank let turn q perhaps could remind caller procedure asking question thanks session operator operator instruction first question geoff meacham bank america geoff meacham hey guy thanks question question otezla head head deucravacitinib aad showed pretty meaningful differentiation wanted ask maybe commercial perspective dataset along advance data change youre thinking positioning otezla marketplace respect psoriasis thank robert bradway murdo murdo gordon yeah thanks geoff question first thing would reiterate anticipated deucra data would indeed show show assumed model put together transaction weve assumed balance year would say continue believe otezla really ideally positioned first line psoriasis market mentioned prepared remark weve market year cumulative patient experience individual globally excellent commercial payer coverage covered life continue make really good progress holding share market really outstanding capability thing course look positioning market hold deucra competitor think really first kind option dermatologist become comfortable using otezla way payer coverage consistent position market pending mild moderate indication data presented aad meeting quite compelling expect able expand utilization otezla psoriasis population milder patient type overall like position market way see still see full detailed safety data look product given part jak family took year patient u understand xeljanz safety profile think lot still understood necessarily safety efficacy otezla geoff meacham okay great thank operator next question michael yee jefferies michael yee question maybe david nice update comment kras maybe could put context around timing data second half around mek maybe talk drive timing disclosure comment around versus think thered different way interpret maybe make comment thought pretty well tolerated got good profile maybe make comment great thanks david david reese yeah thanks mike great question think anticipation meeting right start second half year well start see cohort data outlined mek egfr antibody small molecule inhibitor combination probably see come sequentially second half year accumulate data would say combination therapy program moving along quite rapidly mentioned weve opened new triplet combination feel good status combination regimen term dose comparison study weve got data phase trial well phase trial updated target coverage information pharmacokinetics well course efficacy safety data based modeling wondered could achieve adequate target coverage preserve potentially efficacy profile weve seen milligram thats question going ask quite common continue dose exploration oncology molecule would view par course pleased tolerability profile pointed milligram weve outstanding experience fact one best tolerated drug ive involved year oncology drug development thats really driver potentially get efficacy lower milligram dose enhance patient experience michael yee yeah thank operator next question jay olson oppenheimer jay olson oh hey thanks taking question im curious phase data olpasiran expect first half next year talk sort signal youll looking data term plan design phase study potential point differentiation pelacarsen thank david reese yeah thanks jay may know top head olpasiran formerly amg small interfering rna designed lower lipoprotein level patient atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease elevated lp little may driver noted completed enrollment whats robust phase trial actually completed enrollment ahead schedule well looking unveil data jay first meaning sufficient suppression lp level target would range phase data presented last november american heart association meeting course additional safety data course exploring different dose level pretty much standard program like would part dose selection phase going forward actively engaged already phase planning design sort trial may look like based data weve seen date one goal may relatively infrequent dosing given duration effect observed phase trial thats one thing well taking close look well phase jay olson great thank operator next question matthew harrison morgan stanley matthew harrison great good afternoon thanks taking question wondering could comment little detail repatha trend look like really starting see product break little bit seeing first quarter issue youve sort experienced past couple year think youre point youre going get substantial part penetration also see rest world penetration maybe could comment outlook thanks murdo gordon yeah thank matthew pleased obviously quarter repatha bit journey getting trying ensure patient affordable access repatha particularly medicare part point would say anticipating one exception anticipating relatively stable net price remainder year exception im pointing expand penetration medicare part drag net price function patient entering staying doughnut hole period time thats one downside helping patient medicare part still coverage gap benefit course given durability treatment chronic nature repatha coverage gap quite bit exposure doughnut hole time could tell first quarter able offset small drag net price anticipate well continue penetrate patient population given strong payer coverage commercial medicare weve got covered life important product still million patient treated hyperlipidemia given theyre high risk cardiovascular event globally seeing really strong performance europe america china quite well despite rdl listing continue make inroad japan market operator next question yaron werber cowen company yaron werber great david dont mind question well lumakras relating combo specifically think youve said past havent gotten mtd drug tested combination sound youre continuing explore dose schedule youve also recently talked sequential therapy trying say actually going get data second half testing sequential therapy trying say thank david reese yeah thanks yaron continuing look variety approach combination whether thats combination sequentially think fair say number small molecule egfr inhibitor braf inhibitor mek inhibitor challenge combining think there fair amount work well provide update dont know well data thats robust enough share second half year thats possible dont want promise certainly well provide guidance different regimen move along sequential therapy maybe actually preferred approach operator next question terence flynn goldman sachs terence flynn hi thanks taking question maybe one dave wondering mg dose exploration question best combine kras question wondering bob peter could comment tax proposal coming dc implication puerto rico tax benefit get puerto rico manufacturing side thank david reese yeah thanks terence ill take first part question yeah milligram dose comparison study doesnt really anything combination dosing youre aware combination regimen oncology one typically explores range dos potentially member combination regimen depending backbone may really monotherapy exploration determined see whether preserve efficacy lower dose lower milligram dose robert bradway tax front peter dont share thought peter griffith terence good question look think premature speculate expect administration proposal subject think everybody significant debate within congress stakeholder rest assured active washington ensure position tax system ph continue competitive continue really encourage innovation united state well heard understood ph supportive imagine incentive encourage manufacturing united state territory puerto rico terence would let know tax leader jackie crouse much expertise area puerto rico around tax overall economy function forth shes called upon regularly legislator advice counsel thanks question operator next question umer raffat evercore isi umer raffat hi thanks much taking question david question kras first perhaps could walk u thought process particular say context seen response low perhaps could even give u flavor pk curve look like around dos secondly recall back phase initiated kras powering math really directed o pfs even though primary endpoint pfs realize conversation fda moved towards pfs look like new powering reasonable pfs want understand evolution thought process away o reasonably expect around o data thank david reese yeah thanks umer good question yeah milligram dose chosen based modeling weve done really take account dose level pharmacokinetic data target coverage data accumulated preclinical data regarding efficacy different target coverage level really chosen lower bound thought would potentially preserve could preserve efficacy seeing milligram regard phase trial note change powering really good power progression free survival endpoint done concert regulator able take look overall survival power somewhat reduced term overall survival endpoint think well still pretty good sense drug producing term overall survival part thinking well minimize exposure patient docetaxel control arm umer raffat thank operator next question mohit bansal citi mohit bansal question maybe question murdo onpro done really well pandemic could please remind u often contract negotiated expect reversal onpro trend seeing anything pandemic subsides thank murdo gordon thanks mohit contract arent necessarily schedule large network negotiate annually lot smaller call account contract much basis theyre happening throughout course year question respect reversal asking price trend volume trend clarify question mohit bansal mean trend trend towards using onpro versus pfs given taken product think could kind reversal pandemic subside patient come get shot murdo gordon yeah thank clarification obviously watching clearly pandemic stimulus many oncologist think carefully treatment going use order help minimize amount provider interaction patient would incur meantime though reinforcing actually improve outcome using long acting using onpro particular promotional effort think helping strengthen volume demand curve thing continue point though competition come price erosion new competitor entrant category long acting category anticipate net price negative evolution remainder year mohit bansal got thank much operator next question geoffrey porges svb leerink geoffrey porges right thank much question murdo could discus issue price pretty significant negative price effect first could tell u whether thats whether secondly essentially took significant price increase end year still negative price look like going trend persists throughout year bob perhaps could comment modeling term legislative executive order change pricing going forward usually finger pulse washington thanks murdo gordon sure right thanks geoff let go first overall price evolution portfolio continue believe net negative price portfolio year right number thats continue see know experienced probably peer company first quarter given nature portfolio net negative price evolution patient renewing benefit going benefit hitting theyre kind pocket recess assistance program drag activate payer access end last year brand increased payer coverage cost net price negative evolution anticipate lowest compare little better better thereafter geoffrey porges great thank robert bradway jeff washington im sure whether executive order concern day whether something thats attached reconciliation guess id say greater risk something attached reconciliation still clear administration member democratic party general want try tackle question drug pricing year continuing stay involved youd expect benefit think able demonstrate important innovation progress see made pandemic well continue stay active focus thing could done improve patient access medicine think thing jeff continue shine light role middleman much pharmaceutical dollar wind hand middleman think across country excess think actually well continue draw attention well geoffrey porges right thank operator next question alethia young cantor fitzgerald alethia young hey guy thanks taking question wanted guy talk little bit psoriasis market plan kind penetrating current commercial salesforce especially light potential competition may emerge time bristol also program still underway combination guy thanks robert bradway maybe ill start quickly alethia yeah thats underway continuing work combination come murdo murdo gordon yeah alethia mentioned earlier response question data recently presented ive mentioned past begun primary care promotion otezla currently labeled patient population seen good response term uptake trx performance quarter pretty pleased evolution seeing slowdown psoriasis patient population newly diagnosed patient population particular think direct impact covid causing patient psoriasis see dermatologist starting really beginning pandemic whats happened cumulative effect starting impact patient passed topical option depend patient growth definitely option dermatologist watching closely think could continue create softness psoriasis patient market opportunity recovery thereafter seeing much patient volume dermatology office march april think thing recovering take cumulative effect new patient softness work way market term overall positioning market continue think safety efficacy profile attractive option patient dermatologist first systemic agent think really day rheumatology dermatology physician much aware different category option different profile different class drug think recent data jak category therell speculation hesitancy use product like first option treat patient robert bradway hey erica thanks let go next question operator next question dane leone raymond james dane leone hi thank taking question congrats update start year question sotorasib question really maybe since people asking fairly specific thing think everyones trying analyze update really getting pivotal dataset asco whats team view right ability move sotorasib frontline setting long lot u thought would need successful combination move frontline setting obviously havent seen guy start pivotal dataset said might take longer figure algorithm alternatively go pathway timeline showing u combination data alternative path getting sotorasib frontline long setting thinking might missing call right thank robert bradway yeah thanks dane term potential frontline combination think number examined master protocol enhance efficacy multiple hit pathway could feasible example mek combination egfr inhibitor combination well mentioned whether combination sequentially example rely priming effect question trying answer would also consider additional hit pathway would also fall grouping think well guided emerging data would potential avenue earlier line therapy addition also potentially avenue indication colorectal cancer solid tumor mutation occur operator next question ronny gal bernstein ronny gal good afternoon thank getting may first traditional sotorasib question guess saw data acr patient multiple escape mutation first treated inhibitor wondering concern patient escape quickly multiple mechanism suggests maybe agent enough kind thought course expected second seen peer license china developed tested product bring developed market especially oncology wondering consider strategy especially similar player seems natural complimentary strategy come robert bradway maybe ill start first part murdo address second part yeah term mutational pattern recently reported would say biologically nothing thought surprised u based everything weve learned pathway last year potential mechanism resistance also point way think specific combination may fact help ameliorate resistance pattern point presenting short order also updated comprehensive biomarker data including mutational data think youll find interest certainly helping guide thinking development program well murdo want take second half question murdo gordon yes ronny continue look globally product opportunity license promote world think oncology particular interesting deal done lately obviously strong partnership already company based china beijing continue enjoy partnership would also say given global footprint really excellent partner choice global capability oncology general medicine opening business chinese company japanese company global company absolutely robert bradway okay pushing top hour trying get question bringing next caller operator okay next question carter gould barclays carter gould good afternoon thanks color today maybe switching gear bit moving dcma sound like youre go back clinic maybe give u color sort change protocol dose escalation read broader platform guess focus specifically dcma change comment sort competitiveness increasingly competitive space thank robert bradway yeah carter thanks question expect begin dosing hopefully next week intuited would adjust dose escalation typical use bite molecule well pushing forward broadly obviously want able deliver program offer something patient physician realize might well continually ass program metric broadly im quite pleased progress made amg amg always well always provide cautionary note extrapolating extensively across program much witness clinic target dependent program idiosyncrasy need worked part development program operator next question colin bristow ubs equity colin bristow good evening thanks take quick update guy business development priority current area interest thinking deal size overall guess commentary youre thinking valuation space thanks robert bradway well colin know transacted acquisition first quarter preclinical stage phase ready think reflects breadth interest continuing look acquisition licensing opportunity stated area focus particular immunology inflammatory disease cardiovascular disease cancer attracted u strong franchise therapeutic area know migraine bone health nephrology look commercial opportunity well colin bristow thats helpful maybe quick question term protein degradation obviously platform somewhat early interest expanding youre positioning space robert bradway yeah said think going forward would expect development call induced proximity platform depend internal innovation external partnership potentially acquisition open making lot progress well provide detail bit later colin bristow good thank robert bradway erica gather couple question lined well take remaining question apology audience going allotted hour let get next question operator next question robyn karnauskas truist robyn karnauskas thanks guy addressed little bit moderate severe pressure competition otezla could address little bit granular data tapinarof others topicals think topicals cheaper might push uptake biologics otezla want answer one throwing youre one first rtor application oncology fda controversy development tell u like thats going proceeding normal wondering application process go could faster way market lot new drug thanks robert bradway let try get quickly murdo gordon right

versus say competition pricing think headwind could impact upcoming launch look mild moderate population thank murdo gordon yes thanks geoff would say throughout course last year saw slowdown number psoriasis patient moving market based covid disruption patient visit given otezla early option treatment psoriasis impacted would say biologics tend gain growth otezla slowdown new patient diagnosis last year compound growth rate year good news quarter saw new patient trend tick see growth new patient prescribed prescription quarter however somewhat offset increase number patient switched away otezla another treatment think treatment happen patient going see dermatologist last year price reduction mostly related program usually good indication new patient starting overall would say primarily covid impact respect product coming sure answer say continue like share position share held share psoriasis patient continue feel optimistic growth otezla given pending indication patient come hopefully end year team continue execute well field execution mentioned opening remark improving focused making sure continue grow otezla long haul geoff meacham great thank operator next question ronny gal bernstein ronny gal hi good afternoon thank taking question let start immunology team guy developing stelara indiscernible biosimilars given going side innovation similar world

murdo want indiscernible murdo gordon sure thanks question ronny hesitant go far seeing course inflammation right lot new entrant lot new mechanism lot competition increasing new indiscernible pay secure access also seeing increased management large national pbms national formulary mechanism get placed preferred status versus held reserve patient fail earlier line therapy take rheumatoid arthritis example see tn continuing entrench position novel mechanism likely second perhaps even third line patient failed resolution ra symptom improve progression disease biosimilar dynamic think seeing increase interest payer pbms provider given trend seeing early biosimilars inflammation category think interest biosimilars increase think biosimilar penetration parent molecule originator molecule accelerate new entrant expecting condition indiscernible time launch amgevita overall would come back strength company given portfolio innovator originator molecule enhanced presence biosimilar portfolio think affords u opportunity serve many patient across host autoimmune disease well serve provider payors pbms lot value deliver healthcare system operator next question geoffrey porges svb leerink geoffrey porges thank thank much taking question continue biosimilar guidance specifically denosumab thinking term first biosimilar coming also excuse would expect erosion trajectory brand prolia xgeva similar example indiscernible erosion oncology biologics would expect gradual faster wondering think trajectory look like murdo gordon thanks geoffrey question would say hard project future healthcare system payors provider change adoption biosimilars think given denosumab part b product oncology biosimilar curve would close approximation defining operator next

let begin question session session operator operator instruction first question queue alethia young cantor fitzgerald alethia young hey guy thanks taking question congrats solid guidance great quarter wanted maybe guy could talk little bit obviously kras program combination maybe perhaps kind know probably early phase study kind looking glean different combination know get asked lot kind getting closer closer like think unpacking different indication thanks bob bradway hi alethia thanks question yes get one quite bit combination say generic answer going depend line therapy end indication cell lung cancer course colorectal cancer indication beyond typically looking increment given endpoint beyond standard care also looking totality data think many setting particular survival ultimately overall survival given safety profile demonstrated date sort efficacy metric probably take look operator next question michael yee jefferies michael yee bet going get lot combo kras question going ask well mek expansion cohort david thought really exciting actually completed enrollment know guess mentioned conference well could potentially pivotal talk whether would actually able announce data point year pivotal want whole thing done report could piecemeal data maybe make comment combo well bob bradway yes thanks mike pleased rapidity enrollment mek safety cohort noted moved beyond expansion cohort quite possible data course year depend data come see result early speculate whether could pivotal mentioned master protocol data derived essentially designed given arm blown pretty rigorous phase trial depending indication line therapy course would make sort decision regarding regulatory intent context come data unfold quite happy seeing term enrollment michael yee bob bradway moving along think biologically interesting combination potentially come course year combination well operator next question terence flynn goldman sachs terence flynn maybe maybe peter wondering look sustainability operating margin think put take visibility biosimilar franchise margin know question get frequently higher level maybe bob mentioned protein degradation interesting platform forward guy spending lot time building expect internally area could also look externally opportunity peter griffith thank great question operating margin know go basis also know intend continue biopharma firm look number financial metric importantly operating margin want make sure mention confirm remain flexible adaptable attractive internal external investment opportunity arise underlying objective grow volume tax cash flow really important u committed lean permanent productivity commitment mentioned investing working digitization automation continue exercise muscle make sure remain outperforming biopharma firm operating margin biosimilars fair question continue see biosimilars extremely strong allocation capital u margin continue competitive confident term allocating capital category continue think got strong expertise like quote murdo say played lot defense biosimilars offense able high quality execution level good question flip think bob bob bradway terence thanks question said remark rather calling targeted protein degradation describing induced proximity platform intention said clear think technology building used degrade protein molecule well excited said remark research strategy dave team spent lot time trying think position long term area internal external remind acquired new evolution two year ago purpose helping build set capability would imagine continue look said internally externally dave feel free jump add thought dave reese yes think cover pretty well bob would say view drug part future many know currently desirable target currently undruggable think going important technology making many target tractable bob mentioned investing long haul expect combination internal external innovation operator next question matthew harrison morgan stanley matthew harrison dave wondering could comment little bit bite program guess safety issue happened confidence program especially seems relate extended program dave reese yes thanks matt thank question would say overall feel bullish bite program mentioned amg amg advancing quite rapidly cytokine release syndrome clearly single challenge sits entire field making adjustment program handle quite confident come clinically important profile molecule many bcma molecule development course shape investment according whether really fulfill unmet medical need would say closing quite optimistic extended bite platform positive amg acute myelogenous leukemia done purpose selected first generation molecule investigating minimal residual disease setting technology well suited done close concert investigator many choice part strategy anticipated making choice part prudent shaping portfolio going forward overall feel quite good platform evolving operator next question yaron werber cowen yaron werber david question mind quick sotorasib give u sense obviously encouraging mek combo able get full dose sotorasib comment keytruda erbitux tezepelumab look really good data steroid refractory surprising im sure potentially trial design difference biologics given robust response otherwise would consider repeating study similar trial design one dave reese yes thanks question regard combination one mentioned actively dose escalation looking either different dos case even scheduling depending agent standard phase oncology drug development feel good quickly moving provide guidance expect data emerge tezepelumab mentioned abstract feel data strong feel competitive best high eosinophil population many way standalone low eosinophil population study alluded think potentially trial design issue going investigator anticipate presenting data little later spring discussing partner whether differently designed study would appropriate would point trial necessary filing moving ahead deliberate speed announced global submission tezepelumab based current data operator next question geoff meacham bank america geoff meacham peter may missed looking revenue guidance speak higher level contribution assume sotorasib tezepelumab year covid headwind still factored look product sale assume normalized demand curve year peter griffith thanks question geoff invite murdo moment jump soto teze look expect continued covid impact throughout revenue potential recovery latter part year contingent vaccination rollout mentioned closely monitoring imagine respect soto teze let turn murdo look exciting time u invested lot money getting preparing launch forth murdo murdo gordon thanks peter thanks question geoff obviously quite excited sotorasib want complement dave team fast moved developing product also number regulatory submission able affect compressed time frame optimistic hopeful get fairly quick review multiple market around world would expect sotorasib contribute revenue give guidance large population high unmet medical need lot choice advanced cell lung cancer patient anticipate potential market high need one caution put actual percentage advanced cell lung cancer patient kras status result file medical record right ascertain got work grow number obviously seen targeted therapy actionable mutation testing rate rise fairly rapidly would expect upon approval able nonetheless think sotorasib meaningful contribution least revenue teze see regulatory authority filing obviously given breakthrough designation obviously given result seen guy see breakdown abstract think important medicine get market quickly last question asked covid fact geoff think actually anticipate covid fairly significant impact market better part year beyond midpoint year hope wrong hope vaccination program improve right think covid u majority operator next question evan seigerman credit suisse evan seigerman want ask one business development capital allocation priority seems like growing need asset noting several pipeline pause reported quarter free cash flow going dividend repurchase think bringing larger scale asset would lever beyond current leverage level attractive opportunity bob bradway evan think pretty consistent saying focus investing business said prepared remark planning increase investment r year committing internally continue allocate capital r opportunity continue look externally look small larger opportunity like licensing business development active area demonstrated expertise therapeutically focus likely entail opportunity sit well area demonstrated expertise term balance sheet rather engage hypothetical maintain strong balance sheet strategic flexibility consider individual opportunity arise operator next question dane leone raymond james dane leone congratulation update outlook question focus bit tezepelumab little bit different discussed previously allergy asthma specifically case would new vertical thinking building vertical around expected commercial launch tezepelumab also thinking indication asset behind internally externally could point make broader vertical going forward vein maybe touch little bit oncology obviously solid tumor space area heavily invested historically obviously sotorasib approval coming first half year kind resting bite program behind asset outside bite program could highlight internally might expand presence thinking something differentiated might externally around solid tumor space bob bradway lot dan question murdo double team quickly let remind pointed entered partnership astrazeneca particular around respiratory opportunity point new area u felt could deliver shareholder patient collaborating group demonstrated expertise respiratory medicine chose partner astrazeneca pleased collaboration look forward taking molecule market would point came commitment decade experience biology information able capitalize program hopefully others time murdo jump particular share thought also solid tumor question murdo gordon yes sure thanks bob building team speak help commercialize tezepelumab america region canada focused allergist astrazeneca play broader role beyond allergist including respiratory specialty mentioned new area different done bob mentioned inflammatory disease process thing worth mentioning taking leading role establishing access tezepelumab payer extensive biologics contracting experience part government program help u secure broad access tezepelumab broad range patient saw nice product profile benefit lot patient regardless eosinophilic status dave reese team obviously building medical capability group excited focused effort beauty focusing allergist productive prescribers relatively small audience size quite focused addressing come kind looking oncology portfolio got strong base right oncology hematology business solid tumor therapeutic overall biosimilar portfolio supportive care basically one five oncology patient today receives therapy bringing sotorasib mix potential amg think fairly next year oncology build current strength excited always asking dave reese deliver know team lot earlier asset put clinic turn dave additional comment dave reese exactly got couple gastric cancer bite course also solid tumor indication got molecule late preclinical entering clinic target solid tumor indication ready speak going along think going quite broad portfolio operator next question robyn karnauskas truist security robyn karnauskas question murdo looking mvasi strength kanjinti decline neulasta price decline significant putting trend together help u think think model tail biosimilars difference oncology drug like strength mvasi really impressive versus decline neulasta give sense think help u model thank bob bradway thanks question robyn look would say majority growth come additional international launch biosimilar portfolio obviously additional revenue avsola riabni two relatively recent biosimilar launch specifically think mvasi kanjinti little bit different difference twofold ballistic two major one bevacizumab molecule actually growing whereas trastuzumab molecule flat declining one thing seeing mvasi actually number cycle bevacizumab overall growing even holding share molecule actually hold quite well also le competition factor le competition bevacizumab molecule whereas trastuzumab competitor think going forward would see competitive dynamic shaping two brand little bit differently operator next question mohit bansal citigroup mohit bansal congrats progress maybe one question evenity seems like able grow product globally well difficult market historically could please help u characterize growth term whether taking share existing anabolics expanding market expect challenge technical difficulty come market product bob bradway yes picking little bit static think question evenity first part question understood sourcing evenity growth existing anabolic patient expanding treating new patient catch second part question let address first part overall pleased evenity evolved got nice evolution japan business japan obviously market little bit longer one thing seeing evenity patient product duration treatment replenish new patient source new patient think team japan quite experienced sourcing new patient necessarily got early growth switching anabolics unfortunately lot aging patient market osteoporosis go unchecked patient suffer fracture patient need solid bone builder like evenity able improve clinical outcome think japan sourcing de novo growth perhaps month ago whereas much mix de novo switch thing helping u course prolia evenity customer lot time patient come fracture despite prolia treatment really good candidate evenity often getting patient treatment sometimes month evenity treatment roll back prolia nice franchise agent customer think future growth look good obviously partner ucb getting going europe establish reimbursement product quite excited evenity could become bone building patient operator next question umer raffat evercore isi umer raffat murdo recently mentioned target population kras sounded rather irony least curious whether worldwide b assuming around prevalence rate whether analysis math thank much murdo gordon thanks question umer number actually estimate cell lung cancer incident globally patient obviously reduction lung cancer unfortunately lose patient frontline second line beyond obviously target population launch assume incidence kras broad cell lung cancer patient population umer raffat right murdo go track confused murdo gordon yes number incidence cell lung cancer progressed second line beyond operator next question kennen mackay rbc capital market kennen mackay maybe dave maybe bite spoke previously always love asking question within early stage phase stage pipeline excited going next sotorasib thank dave reese yes thanks think able rejoin time question think term early pipeline amg amg highlighted prepared remark one really looking advanced expansion cohort continue generate data recently larger number patient program would probably discussing potential registration path sooner rather later think amg one step behind another one keeping close eye inflammation portfolio got variety phase asset autoimmune indication previously indicated program one quite interested move forward operator next question geoffrey porges svb leerink geoffrey porges murdo question commercial model mentioned prepared remark couple time shifting digital approach wondering heard significant reduction commercial field organization give u sense magnitude efficiency headcount seeing average sale force moving towards digital could talk think might play world would expect ramp back eliminate social distancing murdo gordon thanks geoffrey question couple factor went recent reorganization field force one portfolio evolution creating capacity new product launch reallocating older side portfolio depending region talking world different stage development example placing large investment field force japan china even russia market emerging u important growth driver really paying close attention force market beyond covid looking potential negative net price effect price reform bob mentioned opening remark bit prevailing wind looking overall commercial model point making productive making efficient largely track plan able move rapidly last year build digital capability even greater extent historically seeing customer willing engage channel think engagement persistent beyond covid quite frankly persistency betting havent done compromised ability competitive share voice field facing interaction medical side commercial side front customer think continue able compete effectively category well augment highly efficient digital channel communication operator next question carter gould barclays carter gould congrats sotorasib data impressive execution guess murdo bob coming back otezla time acquisition seems oriented u majority growth would come guess comment today seem teeing really guess global nature growth going forward guess level confidence around otezla growth timeframe guess given competition bob bradway maybe take first sense two murdo augment however like carter say acquired said felt could achieve growth first several year ownership continue feel confident function potential increased label range well opportunity launch international market murdo maybe want elaborate opportunity mild moderate severe opportunity murdo gordon yes thanks bob see international expansion maturing got good business otezla japan pursuing registration china recently secured reimbursement australia evolving global footprint otezla beyond legacy celgene effort one source growth bob mentioned also pursuing mild moderate approval basis positive data set allow u move otezla patient population really still unmet need patient enough skin surface area might seeking alternative messy inconvenient topical agent think otezla play important role helping treat patient also making investment otezla expanding promotional footprint product include primary care promotion something celgene done historically moderate severe patient well mild moderate indication anticipation potential approval thing would say seeing little bit softness psoriasis broader rheumatology category due covid otezla oral held quite well execution strong also think established safety efficacy profile otezla highly appreciated given recent news broader rheumatology category oral perhaps equation different strong otezla think got good opportunity growth also said gave guidance assumed successful competitive program asset course confirmed today operator next question jay olson oppenheimer jay olson hi congrats progress thank taking question since received breakthrough therapy designation sotorasib china could comment fast could submit filing gain regulatory approval percent asian cell lung cancer patient kras mutation large commercial opportunity sotorasib china thank bob bradway thanks jay yes pleased get breakthrough therapy designation china filing plan move forward colleague beigene provide guidance time line might look like little bit different implication china potentially united state one thing looking quite carefully epidemiology mutation suggestion may little lower prevalence asian population probably mutually exclusive mutation egfr quite high population china japan example important question address got active research collaboration looking murdo

america line open geoff meacham peter lot commentary tax dispute irs earnings call compared first talked last year think probably higher number investor expected question recent discussion agency service prompted broader language today know going take year fully resolve would expect tax reserve change course discussion something going stagnant number fully resolve appropriately make change peter griffith yes goeff thank question look would litigation would comment discussion irs first secondly reserve understand comment term size reserve would simply say confident position level reserve established said puerto rico allocation profit united state territory puerto rico perform majority global manufacturing puerto rico home flagship manufacturing complex presence highly skilled employee billion capital investment said believe irs position without merit going vigorously contest adjustment proposed operator next question come line salveen richter goldman sachs line open salveen richter lumakras step take ensure status recognized physician drive prescription could also frame outlook combo study keytruda reading late summer murdo gordon thanks salveen maybe start turn dave data question obviously working extremely closely oncology provider improve internal system whereby kras status literally fingertip ready making treatment choice patient seeing little bit covid hangover effect many large oncology network short staffed constrained resource deploy thing like emr enhancement thing like better workflow diagnostics biomarkers particularly new biomarkers working literally account account across country made huge improvement seen large community oncology network patient base treated treated community center think academic institution testing strong robust care clear test result available patient progress really community setting working look see different pattern country country advanced biomarker technology clear system like germany france expect good uptake already seeing early indicator france may recall early access program called atu program actually charge product used already fairly broadly germany launching week old japan think network network project working intensely medical colleague commercial team make sure patient slip dave david reese salveen thanks question term data availability noted submitted data one summer oncology conference looking combination sequential approach inhibitor also point one thing beginning examine whole population patient cell lung cancer divide roughly negative tumor third load intermediate expression third high expression negative population instance effect checkpoint inhibitor quite modest area looking combination lumakras straight chemotherapy one thing keep mind field evolves depending expression approach clinically may vary well crafting development program accordingly arvind sood rj let take next question operator next question come line matthew harrison morgan stanley line open matthew harrison great thanks good afternoon hoping question murdo murdo maybe comment know commented business review around thought around contracting specifically biosimilar contracting think humira launch product updated thought term going expectation specifically humira versus murdo gordon thanks matthew question really lot new information update continue feel like extremely well positioned opportunity among first first potentially biosimilar period time market january like profile competitively given recall use existing inflammation commercial organization currently commercialize enbrel otezla relationship intact rheumatologist dermatologist actually gi footprint well supporting u solo feel got customer relationship definitely payer relationship obviously year biologics manufacturing supplying every patient every time provide confidence pharmacy benefit manager make decision make product available early possible excited opportunity course launch amgevita several launch stelara eylea soliris additional launch thereafter six new biosimilars coming market area focused invested area important u growth capability market ensure success arvind sood let go next question operator next question come line yaron werber cowen company line open yaron werber great guess peter maybe rest team guess peter first tax rate increasing incrementally year relating ongoing litigation irs different reason maybe murdo lumakras growing going poll lower expected expecting bigger similar size peter griffith yes let jump first think murdo want take tax part look moving basis point yaron related tax litigation maybe highlight point make response goeff good question little bit earlier commentary think exactly complicated area analyst want make sure understand position think struggle understand folk prior conference call want specific case question related yaron thanks question confident position level reserve wanting provide background hopefully helpful turn murdo get back business murdo gordon thanks peter would say seeing lumakras kras status known point progression treatment second line getting patient treated lumakras penetrating population identification kras status clearly lever need ensure improved answered salveen question earlier really book work urgency really ca patient progressing first line second line choice lumakras really important work patient look epidemiology disease versus would say overall incidence cell lung cancer similar europe term size one thing think go asia incidence kras mutational status bit lower take japan example patient cell lung cancer also kras mutation compared mutational epidemiology change little go outside europe would expect business slightly bigger europe rest world operator next question come line umer raffat evercore isi line open umer raffat guess two may first perhaps kras interesting disclosure slide patient taken commercially data set would suggest perhaps patient drug march trying square two patient therapy march total exposure crude math would suggest duration therapy tracked month consistent observation secondly peter tax court side guide u time line could look like feel like one topic two set liability people put model somehow certain probability sense time line could look like resolution least hearing key core date coming tax code would helpful murdo gordon yes perhaps first question regarding patient number duration therapy think little bit premature able draw conclusion number drug versus number treated get dot duration therapy need understand guess patient got combination patient disease third line beyond potentially challenged product well whereas steady state patient experienced maybe one prior line therapy could quite well indicated data put aacr see patient alive mark think early infer existing patient number understand effective duration therapy fact often say really actually need month market understand period understand duration therapy going quite time know duration therapy peter griffith peter tax side thank term next step time line filing petition tax court within day mentioned vigorously contest notice judicial process plan see consolidation period ongoing tax court case said take several year resolve current time frame see operator next question come line carter gould barclays line open carter gould maybe focus second tezspire looking get little bit color specifically think importance extent could drive inflection sale guess extent impediment date obviously started wayfinder recently past guy kind talked importance source result think wayfinder sort critical addressing gap simply nice color would helpful murdo gordon thanks carter question regarding tezspire really excited market response tezspire novel unique product profile really simplifies treatment severe uncontrolled asthma particularly pulmonologists much else looking simple solution treat patient without limited phenotypic biomarker status overall think going really well clearly benefit permanent market mentioned coming july give confidence provider billing staff code product appropriately high degree assurance reimbursement think know reimbursement happening also tied reimbursement practice run pretty tight cash flow knowing permanent expedite time reimbursement actually help yes say going helpful would say response currently really good clearly providing product patient going reimbursement step process get therapy access medicine yes looking additional sale force sale growth back half year david reese yes carter term wayfinder trial believe address methodologic limitation believe saw source trial sample size much larger trial sample size patient patient higher dose steroid rapid corticosteroid taper looking effect earlier earlier time point think give u confidence see effectiveness tezspire setting lowering oral corticosteroid use addition presented recently quad ai meeting updated data navigator trial showing profound reduction exacerbation patient oral corticosteroid think going really important drug treatment asthma across range phenotype quite confident development program going forward operator next question come line robyn karnauskas truist line open robyn karnauskas couple repatha thought inclisiran permanent coming july thought impact repatha second half year second impressive growth repatha maybe could give little bit color script trend doctor seeing script cardiologist trend give confidence growth continue far prescribing drug versus think previously early day lipidologist mailing murdo gordon thanks robin pleased evolution repatha growth actually fairly consistent across broad cardiology community podologist variety cardiologist seeing general community cardiologist also large effort focused integrated delivery network hospital system successful establishing standardized way treating million ascvd patient end acute care facility mi event admitted unfortunately many even get lipid panel many get discharged without appropriate recommendation initiation treatment stepped quite bit seeing improvement quality care patient discharged community cardiologist primary care physician clearer intent aggressive therapy cardiovascular risk reduction definitely helping future growth obviously going continue effort going continue expand idn work going also going invest incrementally primary care given seeing spontaneous prescribing primary care pleased growth repatha thing would mention got jan listing repatha china national reimbursement drug list good launch u team china nice job ensuring repatha option ascvd patient country really think got large amount headroom growth product large patient population got good momentum cardiology need continue build primary care around world respect inclisiran obviously competitor market given yet event reduction data even reimbursement coding think still limited promote ton patient need aggressive therapy aggressive cardiovascular risk reduction see market bear lot people talking severe disease number one killer world everybody concerned patient overall still bullish bob bradway rj know got several color still hoping ask question want give caller head probably go minute top hour take next question best get everybody unable obviously arvind team available later operator next question come line mohit bansal well fargo line open mohit bansal maybe question tezspire given right need administered provider kind reservation expect doctor point term prescribing agent given dupi available self administration question possibility future could come injection could actually help become product murdo gordon thanks mohit unfortunately severe asthma especially uncontrolled severe asthma acute condition many patient frequent care pulmonologists allergist seeing physician regular basis think given convenient month dosing seen fairly easy product administer course early day launch feedback physician administration barrier initiation tezspire allergist particular used product think benefit side really playing much le work biomarker side phenotypic assessment side simplified workflow regard think long haul continue evaluate need ensure convenience maintenance patient obviously looking indication life cycle opportunity test buyer continue ass whether want provide option mean clearly product could developed way continue look operator next question come line dane leone raymond james line open dane leone congrats quarter one question presuming dose equivalency study lumakras actually demonstrates equivalent playing managing transition end year reason get question lot investor obviously coincide presumable launch competitor kras space maybe frame script given script given end year dose equivalency show lower dose equivalently effective turn script team thinking managing expected change pricing would enacted lower dose seen equivalent murdo gordon yes pretty detailed hypothetical would say first remain confident dose right dose clearly safety efficacy benefit product look good given data clearly high bar u able see approved upon lower dose one question remains answered way guess ca directly answer question many different complicated variable would say continue look best way provide right treatment continuing patient cell lung cancer patient prescribed lumakras taking responded stable sure oncologist going want lower dose continuing patient seen disease area might dose change either go go patient stable dose usually stay would one bit additional commentary question wait see data handle according data say fda guy u operator next question come line evan seigerman bmo capital market line open evan seigerman wanted ask one murdo otezla full label kind full spectrum approval last december seen sort barrier mild patient patient need go sort step edits able get pretty freely expect change course year love get color pushing marketing patient murdo gordon thanks question evan really pleased response payer pbms ensuring expanded label regardless severity psoriasis patient strong access good affordability product fact actually improved access year versus last year able produce prior authorization criterion thing like percentage body surface area medical policy prior authorization described percentage many removed actually opened access patient think year prescribe otezla milder patient american academy dermatology meeting march spoke many dermatologist asked prescribing experience like reimbursement experience think many played back u otezla easier past prescribe milder patient thing enhanced system bridging program ensure launch would go well far good good start anticipate access impediment arvind sood rj consideration folk east

nadella yes let first thanks keith question let start overall term workload mix fairly stable hybrid value proposition really continued resonate mean there bunch workload migrating cloud people use azure stack plus azure continues drive lot iaa growth u people sort looking basically lift shift lot current data center workload top even modernization apps accelerating drive lot higher level service particular data service well ai service ai service essentially compute happens compute requires storage data thats another place see increasing acceleration one thing would say increasingly seeing tier workload sense think commitment made biggest brand world term theyre one core operation two running cloud thats one thing definitely market difference u amy hood question per user service

bellini goldman sachs please proceed question heather bellini wondering amy satya help u think azure hybrid benefit changed type net expansion rate experiencing ela come renewal know kind little bit touching karl way help think particular might helping expansion rate account help u think might might helping drive growth existing contract question would mentioned moving per user consumption going see growth consumption based service versus per user azure workload growth im kind wondering could share u gross margin impact one higher gross margin anything taking parsing comment think azure gross margin progression going forward satya nadella first one actually think hybrid used benefit sort best kept secret im actually hoping going next fiscal year much better job customer much better job dont benefit advantage azure hybrid used benefit across entire workload pretty phenomenal good set session partner meeting week really making sure everybody understand benefit dont think really played anything growth seen spite broadly revenue driving growth second question ill even say following think clearly difference gm per user consumption key even consumption service come different form ir service data service higher level service iot service even saas component therefore think mix different increasingly strategy many time get customer get going core storage core compute scale higher level service amy hood id say heather two component add azure benefit think starting satya said started see impact opinion kpi really window value continue see sql next year think opportunity customer realize real value hybrid benefit add confidence high teen kpi growth year customer value oriented offer question gm satya obviously correct one id say way think actually talking azure per user really

think edge computing become relative centralized cloud computing satya nadella yes think vision always distributed computing sense remain distributed dont split edge computing cloud computing need computing secular basis going increase need reason larger amount data need storage compute world get embedded computing thats building think real competitive advantage differentiation one programming model one identity model security management modern developer well use compute available azure sphere azure reality modern workload fact lose like build azure sphere application build application thats fundamentally distributed also happens ransom compute azure sphere think future distributed computing going back need truly distributed even driven even versus thing let migration something new operator next question coming line keith bachman bank montreal please proceed question keith bachman satya wanted direct could id like understand view dynamic current positioning compared market opportunity context question dynamic remains fairly small part revenue well look market share dynamic serve fairly small part market served think need larger impact market opportunity satya nadella

nomura line open romit shah okay thanks thanks leaving guidance end presentation really kept u seat great result question nand pricing pricing mentioned nand modestly based guidance seems like nand business well dram healthy august would say several report largest competitor seeing significant asp weakness nand business im hard time trying reconcile isnt seeing weakness well dave zinsner yes think wont comment fourth quarter guidance whats built think right youre seeing pretty healthy mix higher value solution getting increasingly higher mix component nand nand business thats really helping keep pricing healthy romit shah say though even absent mix seems like nand pricing far le prior quarter correct dave zinsner yes romit shah okay kind question reconcile performance nand business pricing seems like asp decline fairly modest seems bigger broader weakness competitor dave zinsner well think one case second quarter look pricing bit aberration guess id call given first quarter higher asp lift related kind onetime mlc sale actually think strip done dont think made comment second quarter would found asp decline relatively modest well romit shah okay could follow sanjay mehrotra want point dave said remark mix nand business improved substantially given successful execution strategy shifting product toward high value solution multichip package nand dram carry higher asp sequential basis doubled sale solution market course well ssd well hit record mix really drove strong performance asp front nand business romit shah okay great noticed dram nand really wasnt much bit growth business still comfortable bit growth target dram nand calendar thank sanjay mehrotra yes comfortable target said proceeding well transition production actually achieved bit output crossover one quarter earlier planned dram side continued well nanometer technology transition said bit output crossover end calendar year similarly good progress term nanometer dram yes respect overall bit growth target year said believe industry range nand somewhat higher remains case respect dram said calendar year industry supply bit growth approximately range stay well ill point supply shipment growth flat dram nand questioning really related normal ebb flow business term qualification product new technology node well ramp production technology operator thank next question come line muse evercore line open muse yes good afternoon thank taking question guess first question gross margin take midpoint smidge curious thinking change mix dram nand driving perhaps slowdown cost given challenge ahead et cetera would love hear thought dave zinsner yes well probably wont get much detail guidance say give range high end range would actually improvement quarter thats certainly scenario would encompass robust mix higher margin product sure somewhat mix dependent business factor might happen creates bit range u wouldnt look much fact midpoint slightly muse okay trying get color mix thanks guess larger picture question dram last month weve heard select capacity think first industry enjoying margin today guess speak guess new rational profitability focused market would love hear kind thought market today beyond sanjay mehrotra said length investor day highlighted market today structurally different compared ever past u theyre ever diversified market dc dram mean data center driving large growth dram ai trend early inning requires dram order really perform high performance competition ai application rely driving ai application driving growth data center well intelligent device edge smartphones certainly feature ar vr ai getting implemented phone along high resolution camera require dram well demand driver diverse theyre secular nature memory become essential term delivering value proposition end market application really driving overall robust demand driver industry dram whether data center mobile graphic automotive application need memory memory really enabling higher value well end market application yes bodes well healthy industry fundamental reflects guidance well speaks robust strong guidance provided third quarter operator thank next question come line john pitzer credit suisse line open john pitzer dave guess first question revolves around profitability level sbu kind curious think underutilization charge xpoint peaked sort quarterly basis think mentioned prepared comment move help profitability guess think longer term notwithstanding youre selling intel sort cost think operating margin trajectory business compared business unit dave zinsner going back prepared remark underutilization charge associated xpoint basis point hit sbu operating margin sold little xpoint partner certainly relatively high level hard say indeed peak certainly close peak peak think longer term underutilization perspective could continue sell wafer partner certainly would mitigate underutilization charge wouldnt dismiss likelihood happening top sanjay mentioned earlier call expecting xpoint product towards end calendar year ramp certainly help improve underutilization aspect thing go away said looking try improve cost structure storage business unit certainly transition wafer meaningful improvement cost structure sbu sanjay mehrotra ill point short period time quarter eventually really driven tremendous momentum ssd sale sbu yes mostly driven starting ramp focus bringing next generation product market nvme solution well based solution cloud application help improve cost structure certainly bode well health sbu business going forward excited opportunity nand die technology focused continuing accelerate product introduction get benefit advanced technology node well reduce overall cost ssd build know ssds memory go building ssd extremely focused bodes well cost structure ssd solution well growth ssd business john pitzer sanjay know guy sort rightfully tried get away giving u quarterly bit growth cost projection dram nand wonder generically think dram transition nand transition layer quarter think going get maximum benefit benefit august quarter november quarter think dram nand sanjay mehrotra term cost continuing ramp dram technology production said latter half year achieve bit crossover technology node continue ramp production even course next year like ramp several quarter well ongoing basis continue provide u cost benefit story nand side focused continuing go beyond bit crossover continue increase mix technology production ready technology prepared remark said second half year ramp continue provide additional cost benefit ongoing basis really cant say quarter cost reduction peaking general gradual course future quarter please forget im talking nand im talking nand technology level cost reduction capability course nand cost also function mix mean mcp solution tend carry cost dram well tend highest cost measure cost per gigabyte nand similarly ssd solution cost also tend higher cost dont confuse reported cost change underlying technology capability cost reduction mix play role reported margin number talk operator thank next question come line joe moore morgan stanley line open joe moore wonder could talk capital spending talked low percentage sale obviously sale coming lot better least expected year youll sort high low comment mean think sort spending le want year indication give u mean next year dave zinsner mean low model clearly year low year might little bit low robust year revenue perspective plan wanted make investment dram nand plus cleanroom space talked hiroshima singapore also investment capital investment r organization think fact bit revenue opportunity make investment take advantage year clearly model id tell next year im assuming joe real source question try figure next year might look like dont know exact number yet mean still working operating plan next year think sanjay discussion analyst day made great point capital intensity business going thought low percent revenue made sense think wanted make guess certainly suggest capex next year magnitude exactly would break think yet determined u go process quarter granular fashion make sure getting good roi everything every dollar put capex think end fourth quarter providing guidance well give specific number term capex joe moore okay thats helpful thank wonder bunch written antitrust concern obvious would im wondering provide context around article thing sanjay mehrotra cant really comment much authority china visited office may believe requested certain information course cooperating would like point absolutely remain focused disciplined operating highest integrity method operator thank next question come line blayne curtis barclays line open blayne curtis hey guy thanks taking question curious dram saw nice uplift asp think youve seen pricing market least swapped pricing come curious little color mix helped think mentioned server graphic curious outlook segment look second half calendar year sanjay mehrotra think server graphic continue see growth strong growth area trend described earlier cloud billion device edge becoming intelligent trend ai absolutely driving demand shared investor day example ai driven ai training driven compute workload like amount dram amount ssd trend really secular nature beginning way mobile term low power dram strong position dram content requirement going continuing increase certainly graphic console gaming well crypto driven demand continues overall long term strong trend well blayne curtis thanks maybe question dave wanted maybe clarification nand asp mix look like cost wanted make sure function selling higher value part module curious dave zinsner yes youre right sanjay even mentioned mix multichip product mobile healthy quarter nand dram component asp high theyre margin accretive would point cost actually higher cost asp go expand margin nand side basis point operator thank next question come line srini pajjuri macquarie line open srini pajjuri thank let echo congrats well guess sanjay quick question server demand talked said data center dram nand grew see nand business outgrowing market im curious seem outgrowing dram overall server demand server market well im curious whats driving share gain comment sanjay mehrotra think strong execution product enabling u really broaden deepen reach cloud customer course last quarter cloud used represented respect total share look total share dram industry look cloud used represented strengthening execution share increased line rest overall dram industry share really sheer execution product roadmap ability work closely customer understand requirement term technology term product certainly understanding term supply well able fulfill requirement successfully important area focus u pleased performance company dram side well nand side growth market srini pajjuri maybe dave dave capex low capex guidance talked talked expanding cleanroom nand well dram believe dram nand guess assume nand dram bit growth sustain current level think youll need cleanroom space whenever implication capex sanjay mehrotra difficult predict would need additional cleanroom space obviously node transition requiring footprint floor space move increasingly higher technology sure could predict exactly well need trying carefully build supply consistent sanjay indicated expectation around industry growth rate operator thank next question come line amit daryanani rbc capital market line open amit daryanani guess two well first headwind mentioned xpoint thats impacting may quarter think number august quarter baked guide regard number see getting neutral level essentially dave zinsner mentioned earlier roughly range next quarter assuming sell xpoint partner wouldnt rule said could happen quarter multiple quarter quite honestly sell product partner would certainly reduce mitigate underloading charge absent think expectation mentioned xpoint product would start introduced late calendar expectation would start ramp shortly thereafter well start see benefit term bringing underutilization charge time amit daryanani could cloud server demand especially hyperscale side fairly robust guy think across dram nand understand medium long term dynamic guy outlaid near term guess concern perhaps strength seen customer prebuying buying ahead may see period digestion next couple quarter use capacity theyve taken guess sit visibility comfort whatever shipped hyperscale oems getting used absorbed prebuying end sanjay mehrotra pointed earlier work closely customer really building strong relationship across board see trend building holding product dont see mean demand cloud application continued increase heard cloud operator major cloud operator increased capex calendar basis calendar capex spend major cloud holder increased cloud operator increased course meaningful part total cost capex cloud operator certainly going towards compute storage memory playing good role term supporting need customer see trend work closely assessing overall demand requirement expectation keep mind global trend term cloud data center growth several large operator around world well engaged ever pause one doesnt overall matter total trend one continuous growth given value memory fast storage brings end market application cloud provider enabling consumer well business operator next question come line harlan sur jp morgan line open harlan sur given normalization nand pricing team starting see price elasticity effect starting kick word guy work customer second half product launch seeing ssd attach rate notebook pc increasing seeing content per application area like smartphones iot device sanjay mehrotra yes certainly see

nand continue strong mean look data center cloud application ai early inning whole cloud growth early inning well see dram requirement enterprise cloud data center application growing much faster total average dram industry demand growth cagr course year similarly mobile application dram growing nicely well machine learning kind feature facial recognition et cetera get implemented phone already starting see gigabyte even gigabyte coming smartphones day far youll even see gigabyte smartphones similarly nand front look average capacity increasing smartphones youre seeing gigabyte smartphones offered day terabyte smartphones far away certainly elasticity nand average capacity client computing application well mobile device increase well attach rate ssds increase important look demand trend feel confident trajectory one two quarter certainly ebb flow term demand supply industry trend positive specific capex id point prudent disciplined managing capex absolutely focused profitability roi mentioned capex cleanroom construction facility upgrade increasing billion compared last year dave mentioned represents total capex guidance provided example discipline capex management nand term equipment capex fiscal year versus actually reducing capex fiscal year versus extremely focused technology conversion technology transition best way u achieve cost competitiveness well roi investment adding wafer start ph competitor may talked industry romit shah think lot u certainly believe strong secular trend driving business whats little surprising though rate change

fundamental nand side mentioned year calendar see nand supply output growth approximately know industry course last several month gone major transition nand nand industry point already transition term total bit calendar year basis level going forward nand well look transition future kind consideration increased technology complexity reduced bit gain per wafer transition see moderation industry supply aspect first half operator thank next question come amit daryanani rbc capital market line open amit daryanani thanks lot thanks taking question guy guess two thing well first could maybe help understand think gross margin guide fiscal basis point think sequentially much due tariff issue versus whats going memory broadly go fiscal think margin improve throughout year especially result tariff issue challenge dave zinsner yes first gross margin guidance course hit higher end range would basis point clearly tariff impacting u probably tune basis point talked working step mitigate obviously take time thing operationally get place isnt impactful itll quarter two probably start see benefit improvement certainly factor gross margin side would say general market dram healthy market nand weve built various expectation depending kind thing play revenue perspective certainly drive gross margin adjustment well suffice say look comparison gross margin think first quarter im mistaken basis hit within range expect anywhere basis point amit daryanani thats really helpful dave guess could follow nand side specifically pricing degraded couple month data obviously report show declined well quarter think somewhat surprised havent seen demand elasticity output demand guess improving much dramatically im curious attribute perhaps fact demand hasnt stepped attractively pricing come think there time lag get somewhat reason arent seeing sanjay mehrotra let take term demand elasticity certainly seeing think smartphones see move higher capacity referred previous comment indiscernible previous question ssds particularly related consumer channel related ssd benefit lower priced nand certainly youre starting see already lag average capacity increase channel well overall nand definitely continues benefit price elasticity operator next question come line tim arcuri ubs line open tim arcuri thank two sanjay first wanted see provide color sort term reduction cost dram

retain flexibility term managing ongoing basis well operator thank next question come line aaron rakers well fargo question please aaron rakers yes thank taking question two well kind building last question think said le incremental capacity increase compared im wondering could provide u framework think next phase transition nand term bit output increase per wafer perspective quick sanjay mehrotra point providing specific much gain per wafer think obvious well going layer future generation beyond tend reduce bit gain per wafer obviously along assumption industry ramp baked overall guidance fiscal year calendar year nand bit growth slowing give le gain saw onetime increase nand bit growth industry went transition going forward revert back curve le le bit gain course capex

course effect cpu shortage continue improve situation course year expect also contribute toward improvement demand second half calendar year compared first year operator thank next question come line john pitzer credit suisse line open john pitzer yes good afternoon thanks letting ask question sanjay guess wanted little bit detail behind decision actually shutter dram capacity current quarter last quarter talked flattening cost curve actually increased useful life holding inventory seemed make sense seems little bit reversion given big enough piece dram market think impact overall really kind depends upon guy korea kind curious came decision shutter capacity sanjay mehrotra think dave previously mentioned one earning call day inventory something comfortable really look demand time look production output think important u bring supply line expected demand year provides u obvious benefit term managing inventory effectively managing cash flow effectively well really managing business healthy fashion course inventory good cost obsolescence issue inventory really consider prudent management business bring supply growth line demand expectation dave zinsner id add underutilization cost incur going help layer cost per unit taken period cost within quarter implied gross margin guidance third fiscal quarter sorry interrupt john john pitzer sanjay explained fiscal youll grow industry nand bit move fourth generation wondering could help u understand cost implication cost curve nand negatively impacted able benefit continued mix towards technology side product mix managed nand think cost fiscal year sanjay mehrotra cost position good fiscal year today well technology absolutely outperforming industry term die level cost per gigabyte basis obviously know discussed many time past benefit come cmos array architecture pioneered currently third generation using give u significant cost advantage carry well giving u competitive mix nand production fiscal year meet market demand keep mind fourth generation nand first node replacement gate technology even greater number layer actually greater capital intensity associated transition floating gate replacement gate requires tool specific unique tool implement replacement gate really converting portion portfolio first generation replacement gate technology remainder portfolio convert third generation floating

transition u summary even increasing number layer third first generation replacement gate feel good cost competitiveness mix floating gate replacement gate technology achieving next year operator thank next question come line muse evercore question please muse good afternoon thank taking question guess question used word idling regarding dram reducing nand wafer start guess two question trying send u different signal term could provide little clarity think impact cost structure slow wafer start turn back think impact thank sanjay mehrotra reducing output dram nand dram reduction supply growth result idling capacity idling wafer start bigger impact nand reduce wafer start particularly related legacy node impact supply bit growth smaller wafer start reduction mentioned primarily targeted toward legacy node objective bring supply growth toward estimation demand dram nand point view well timeframe respect cost said continued outperform term cost reduction cost reduction

barring macroeconomic uncertainty case determination microeconomic climate different impact outlook based know today assessment demand expectation operator thank next question come timothy arcuri ubs line open timothy arcuri sanjay wanted go back question got asked dram still well cash cost yet idling capacity obviously demand lot worse expected sound pretty optimistic going come back back half year would reduce start youre optimistic demand coming back back half year get inventory trying reconcile two comment seems like leaving money table thanks sanjay mehrotra demand weak far year expect demand environment weak first half well talk total dram demand growth expectation talking full year basis right need look supply growth course looking full year basis want bring supply line demand expectation believe improving demand environment second half versus first half referred earlier able capture benefit supply cutback mentioned also help bring time continue drive improvement inventory position well timothy arcuri okay quick dave wanted go back question cost bringing dram cost kind like low nand kind seems like action ultimately impact ability cost level missing something sound like saying impact reconcile thanks dave zinsner expect healthy cost decline dram nand year still making technology transition next year would obviously expect particularly dran cost good said replacement

potentially masking weakness customer specifically might anxiety seems like think condition pretty strong customer seem lot lease end product inventory precautionary remark side something seeing creates anxiety sanjay mehrotra sorry going say let address first definitely dave expand environment supply shortage course underlying demand trend market participating continue strong supply shortage given fluid situation related spread coronavirus various country rate pace different ultimately depend upon rule regulation different government may impose potentially impact supply industry like accumulating inventory make sure supply disruption legitimate think customer also building inventory make sure supply chain control think part mindful although look economy economy student certainly driving greater demand enterprise pc side certainly placing address quite bit constraint stress infrastructure cloud infrastructure enterprise infrastructure definitely driving increased demand well backdrop think mindful term making comment let dave elaborate dave zinsner yes think covered sanjay good thing add think believe strength data center market real inventory level normal market operator thank next question come timothy arcuri ubs timothy arcuri thanks lot guess sanjay language release guy talked fact lagging indicator relative demand help parse guess sound like maybe suggesting fiscal fourth quarter could maybe sequentially typically know difficult tell going right maybe help u walk put take look like know want guide sound like possibly help u think thanks sanjay mehrotra certainl know tim guiding course environment fluid unprecedented time term anybody dealing business vertical country dealing situation spread containment coronavirus would say respect assessment demand trend think underlying demand trend definitely continue healthy look supply customer customer build product macroeconomic weakness know environment coronavirus pandemic impact aspect consumer demand consumer demand lag consumer demand getting impacted demand customer building product supply chain getting impacted mean sometimes lag supplying customer versus impact demand marketplace guiding fourth quarter think important depend spread virus containment virus different country may containment different rate seen example last fiscal quarter demand china consumer demand smartphone demand declined also seen china contained fact production coming back china demand restored china thing happen part world well may impact smartphone demand different country eventually containment happens consumer demand back trend certainly business strong trend driving greater content smartphone come back side pandemic demand driver reassert similarly cloud demand continues well mentioned scenario may actually accelerating demand cloud driving greater demand memory storage point situation fluid really prepared guide point operator next question come john pitzer credit suisse john pitzer thanks detail especially given uncertain environment kind curious sanjay dave possible quantify impact covid february quarter importantly number mind may clear uncertainty increasing range may guide also bringing midpoint sort guidance thinking would helpful sanjay mehrotra let dave address dave zinsner okay yes sure maybe without throwing number difficult estimate clearly would range revenue mitigation expense already cost sale operating expense impacted u bit fiscal second quarter well would likely skewed higher growth number fiscal third quarter course somewhat unusual u widened range couple hundred million dollar also account uncertainty relates might happen demand perspective supply perspective either one risk additionally built cost associated covid mitigation u sanjay already talked fact carrying higher level inventory raw material also flex supply chain back redundancy drive expense cost sale side addition may see increased level tariff expense effort mitigate supply disruption might occur also fair amount expense associated model allow enabling employee able work office home expense associated expense might likely would likely would even particularly action taken reduce expense fact bit offset headwind associated mitigation expense third quarter operator thank next question come muse evercore line open muse yes good afternoon thank taking question great hear safe well guess question regarding supply side particularly dram talked issue related equipment installation part availability also talked switching capacity mobility server curious think bit production look like either industry calendar think thinking kind coming still right number change thank sanjay mehrotra think said scenario calendar year dram demand growth would around supply would somewhat le year supply growth would somewhat le year demand growth course look scenario supply growth technology transition node transition industry perhaps impacted tool delivery engineering service support industry soon tell point could impact supply related wafer output could impact supply said depending upon rule regulation order various country supply chain memory storage exists order impact production could supply growth impact well hard tell point certainly look current supply growth current supply growth point intact mindful change could occur due covid environment course continue watch demand well supply side take action today shortage supply mentioned server dram well cloud overall shortage dram therefore shifting supply mobile dram side course continue keep track demand look like said evaluate making reduction production utilization term capex aspect manage supply growth calendar year soon really give specific projection operator thank next question come mehdi hosseini sig line open mehdi hosseini yes thanks taking question david sanjay please tell think mix revenue china especially going back sanjay said earlier china resuming operation also providing incentive adoption curious china accounted revenue february fall see trending remainder year sanjay mehrotra let dave answer dave zinsner think cumulative revenue ill go back look exact statistic somewhere kind think china revenue aggregate clearly said comeback work kind phenomenon going china economic stimulus certainly benefit also customer lot cloud space course big driver business today

course cost reduction function technology transition made fabs far plan respect cost guidance provided fiscal year dave zinsner would add nand front seen gotten fair amount benefit change depreciation first half fiscal essence kind pulled ahead remember probably mentioned transition replacement gate would show minimal cost decline really would see depreciation change reality happening kind pulling ahead improvement fiscal look percentage better maybe good originally kind telegraphed addition continue drive mix high value solution generally carry higher cost hope continue goal get certainly also impact cost side well step back look multiyear period term nand improvement really running second generation replacement gate good momentum right yield running inventory showing cost sale see multiyear period see arc declining cost multiyear period actually good healthy competitive sanjay mehrotra would add due said enabling greater flexibility supply network adding captive capacity well

sanjay prepared remark noted expectation dram market condition rather improve second half calendar guess curious making statement sort assumption making demand side well supply side next couple quarter appears though seeing supply side cut also peer anything demand outlook server space remains fairly muted today expect server demand remain weak therefore expecting recovery second half sort key driver timing recovery thank sanjay mehrotra first let point said recovery second half calendar year said second half fiscal year dram course driver growth secular nature trend ai course continuing driver growth mean lot let industry point view enterprise server weak thats impacting demand outlook also remember context first half year first half calendar year entered year definitely looking strong demand trend building year inventory large normalized industry got hit covid definitely impacted demand outlook accelerated cloud accelerated enterprise well financial sector invested enterprise server side however enterprise generally weak cloud demand given streaming kind application driven strong growth cloud side expect cloud continue healthy second half course first half calendar year saw surge demand cloud second half expect somewhat moderated compared first half level cloud continue healthy place timeframe driver growth well phone strong driver growth remember covid total smartphone unit sale got impacted got lowered something around basis smartphone sale expected pick fact smartphone sale already picking marketplace right story increasing smartphone sale go calendar beyond seasonally slower first quarter calendar also story higher content memory storage demand driver driving giving u optimistic outlook dram demand calendar year continuing improve

well underlying momentum product portfolio nand dram position u well go calendar year toshiya hari thank operator thank next question come john pitzer credit suisse please go ahead john pitzer yeah good afternoon guy thanks letting ask question sanjay dave wanted talk little bit kind margin profile november beyond dave mentioned huawei ban going see mix shift towards nand roughly kind august quarter think trend november february get worse february guess given guy ahead schedule move higher value nand think gross margin progression nand know mix hampered lack cost replacement gate kind curious think gross margin progression going forward nand given already hit mix high value target dave zinsner okay question one good job john let talk little mix obviously mix pretty favorable fourth fiscal quarter dram jumped quite bit previous quarter low percent total revenue would expect come modestly nand come modestly sure going significant story around gross margin certainly headwind tough call second quarter expect continued growth nand probably flattish dram there probably little bit incremental mix headwind sanjay indicated back half fiscal year bullish around lot market dram support like cloud like mobile space expect healthy recovery dram beyond mentioned high value solution obviously helpful accretive business far continuing drive fact actually story even beyond nand go dram space example graphic talked would start little bit headwind gross margin first fiscal quarter early ramp product hit stride go fiscal calendar would expect beneficial gross margin side mentioned also replacement gate know replacement gate kept cost reduction nand front relatively flat fiscal real cost reduction got fiscal nand really depreciation change there huge change fiscal first quarter around nand replacement gate still major story sanjay talked ramping replacement gate next year benefit think cost reduction quite positive helpful driving said prepared remark low cost decline nand thats mix factor even better without also would say dram front looking cost reduction next year even mix pretty respectable includes increased cost higher margin product shipping next year also include graphic also benefit gross margin well think said nand said low cost actually low say cost reduction cost reduction instead low cost reduction john pitzer dave maybe another way ask question take pricing equation know thats biggest driver driver sort gross margin progression headwind peaking november quarter would expect stick around february beyond dave zinsner dram front whether extends second quarter possible think back half year certainly going good story gross margin front get mature yield product nand front think really think bigger driver going switchover replacement gate thats really start see cost improvement pretty high level high value solution nand front john pitzer right thanks operator thank next question come muse evercore please go ahead muse yeah good afternoon thank taking question guess dave follow john question could isolate dram gross margin side thing look like implied gross margin november around curious thats fiscal trough within much conservatism around pricing huawei inventory guess kind snapback specifically mix around hbm graphic see term gross margin snapback second half fiscal dave zinsner yeah huawei impact gross margin front largely accounted fourth fiscal quarter although potential depending rest bit get consumed high value product within dram clearly first couple quarter somewhat kind headwind gross margin simply kind ramp timing challenge happens seeing pricing little bit negative happens coincide couple quarter cost kind running higher dont really think mean somewhat challenge correct time particularly though product get mature yield get mix going right direction u would tell relates obviously dont want go detail around difference margin dram nand specifically would tell estimate dram low relative reality muse helpful thank operator thank next question come blayne curtis barclays please go ahead blayne curtis hi guy thanks taking question curious huawei want confirm think said shipping story company getting

question muse yes good afternoon thank taking question guess demand question there clearly fear around pc speaking volatility around handset there inventory build cloud side yet youre talking dram nand remaining tight calendar guess walk youre seeing demand perspective also think importantly particularly dram side youre thinking supply clearly seems constrained year next year sanjay mehrotra thanks demand side certainly see strong demand across almost end market pc basis calendar year growth course ssd attach rate average content continues increase nand side continue pc continues drive healthy demand dram well data center digestion period earlier year second half driving strong demand u well smartphone trend driving unit sale well average content growth automotive cant meet supply cant meet demand strong industrial market demand strong across board almost across end market seeing strong demand fact industry unmet demand know semiconductor shortage across technology ecosystem semiconductor shortage get alleviated time actually going create demand memory storage every end application today whether analog memory cpu actually required memory storage semiconductor shortage actually impacting demand get alleviated course next seven quarter bring increased demand demand trend strong supply see year end year calendar year tight well know capex industry dram side extremely disciplined producer inventory supplier inventory running extremely lean well certainly speak inventory day inventory extremely low well capital intensity increasing well industry bodes well disciplined supply growth well talked spec industry jedec spec actually requires chip ecc result bigger die size everybody industry well understand industry transition course next several quarter well mean le supply growth availability wafer even technology transition trend demand side well supply side bode well industry muse thats helpful could gross margin side dave talked prepared remark around higher cost mix investment supply chain walk moving part fiscal gross margin dave zinsner obviously one bigger component margin fiscal going around pricing dont provide pricing beyond next fiscal beyond quarter say think pricing next quarter suggesting would tight least thats much give pricing side cost front look cost reduction well see next year basis driven sanjay mentioned prepared remark ramp ramp nand front feel like cost good counter see higher mix product carry higher cost sanjay mentioned like higher density server module ssds thing bit headwind cost front likely go year covid mitigation cost also bit headwind hopefully course year alleviates start help margin front factor little bit lift lehi full amount depreciation go away fiscal fourth quarter close sale underload charge also go away way think id model maybe million benefit fourth quarter probably another million first fiscal quarter assuming close somewhere close towards end first fiscal quarter behind u muse thank operator thank next question come john pitzer credit suisse may proceed question john pitzer yes guy two quick question dave maybe question cost want make sure understand messaging get higher part higher cost also higher gross margin thinking incorrectly dave zinsner somewhat depends product would say general trying drive towards higher value product arguably least comparable basis product would carry better gross margin john pitzer perfect two quarter ago dave didnt buy back stock quarter million think free cash flow notwithstanding youve done multiple quarter im kind curious message youre trying give u especially look sort risk reward stock aggressive buyback portend something next fiscal year capex youve talked capex next fiscal year year outgrow bit relative industry dave zinsner okay lot question pack okay buyback wouldnt read anything million quarter well higher level buyback others eye net cash position something trying move right direction think youll find fourth fiscal quarter buyback meaningfully higher third fiscal quarter nothing read feel like price obviously good price buying stock back committed weve talked previously return least free cash flow form buyback talked prepared remark think metric weve hit far weve done pretty well doesnt even account convert think end fiscal quarter fourth fiscal quarter completely done converged conversion completely balance sheet remove dilution well relates message capex relates buyback say given euv investment appear operate maybe little bit different level percent sale perspective perhaps previously operating thinking low think euv safe say probably operating percent revenue capex least build euv part tool set john pitzer perfect thank much operator thank next question come shannon cross cross research shannon cross question dram asp growth highest several year talk talk bit driver growth much price increase given current tight supply versus say benefit mix think sustainability sanjay mehrotra certainly basis pricing increased across board dram industry driven strong demand mentioned earlier pretty much across end market enjoyed price increase across end market mentioned even see price increase dram also see nand shannon cross okay guess given conversation comment made customer moving inventory management unpack little bit term magnitude mean sort conversation youre people theyre dealing supply issue right think something thats going sort meaningful transition within industry thanks sanjay mehrotra see emerging trend industry think course last couple year even maybe somewhat longer time frame challenge respect geopolitical consolidation certainly covid brought stark relief need resilient flexible supply chain look acceleration digital transformation surge demand occurred top impose semiconductor industry shortage leaving lot unmet demand across multiple industry really leading customer ecosystem well u supplier really absolutely prepare supply chain meet demand mean taken action regard term securing capacity example assembly operation really enabled u example muar operation bring team member recent covid outbreak malaysia made change capacity assembly capacity footprint secured external supply assembly capacity enabled u quickly shift production part manufacturing footprint kind consideration customer general supplier general considering make sure theyre able manage supply chain able meet demand thats certainly aspect inventory management proved costly course last quarter particularly world struggled respond need covid time frame yes emerging trend towards considering whether related geopolitical consideration whether related act god result supply chain disruption responding challenge covid emerging trend customer may already reacted faster term building stronger inventory position customer perhaps still scrambling meet requirement definitely trend think likely persist company think supply continuity consideration future like taken step necessary address customer requirement fulfilling demand operator next question come timothy arcuri ubs timothy arcuri thanks lot two question first euv cost sanjay guess first question euv sort whats changed euv mean like there sea change progress made euv simply maybe there another big chipmaker trying get queue taking slot felt like get queue im sort curious changed euv sanjay mehrotra always said monitor euv progress actually engaged euv evaluation euv tool past always said intercept euv roadmap right time see euv platform well ecosystem becomes mature thats plan intercept euv roadmap thats plan timeframe aligned technology leadership dram scaling roadmap well implementing timeframe consistent always approached course euv continued make good progress really think euv technology capability onward timeframe coupled expertise leadership industry really unique differentiated capability absolutely feel confident continuing lead dram scaling roadmap course currently beyond initially deploy euv limited layer count timeframe node broaden node greater layer adoption keep mind combine immersion technique well really believe strong roadmap pretty much along line always intended insert euv roadmap future basically keeping track cost effectiveness productivity well overall scaling roadmap feel really good leadership dram scaling roadmap ahead timothy arcuri guess dave cost down sound little negative little cautious fiscal cost down last quarter think year dram youre going close roughly fiscal year think supposed help next year feeling could better next year fiscal sound like maybe mix issue going result worse next year year sort give u next year relative sort youve done year thanks dave zinsner dont think im ready havent completely finished plan next year maybe little premature talk next year specifically cost down would say look cost decline good timing ramp certainly impact get mature yield state certainly impact course hard call mixed element drive headwind suffice say kind think strategy feel well see many thing enter equation think look basis quite good quite comparable think look mix basis somewhat dependent market unfolds based early view next year term x wed expect headwind operator next question come joe moore morgan stanley joe moore great thank want inventory question youre talking demand fulfilled short term message customer dont really inventory want put inventory place pocket there inventory kind waiting component sanjay mehrotra really varies customer customer customer may reacted fast would carrying adequate level inventory inventory line strategy term cope current environment respect demand supply component whereas customer may le level inventory really varies customer customer im saying regarding shifting towards kind mindset really customer focus managing supply chain sufficient inventory meet requirement customer may moved direction customer may yet move direction mindset towards example car production seeing auto market suffered significant supply chain shortage course incurred significant cost industry well able fulfill supply requirement course drive different mindset avoid kind situation future varies end market end market varies customer customer overall saying lesson geopolitical consolidation lesson pandemic lesson recent supply chain shortage backdrop digital transformation requiring semiconductor solution customer ecosystem part customer ecosystem likely approaching inventory consolidation different manner compared look emerging trend industry operator next question come chris danely citi chris danely hey thanks guy previous question look three main end market dram pc cellphone server guess best guess inventory would say lowest think end market achieve whatever heck normal day level inventory sanjay mehrotra going go term trying break market market course sometimes see different moving part different part market example mobile saw india covid situation well april may china reduction demand certain part smartphone market however part world smartphone supplier moved supply increased demand part world course demand supply shortage supply industry got shifted toward part market going break mean gave mobile one example situation vary customer customer look end market almost end market seeing shortage aggregate tight supply today thats resulting increase price industry reported guided also dram nand see price increase overall see supply tightness continuing year timeframe well chris danely well sanjay mehrotra meant chris danely well great ill take sanjay mehrotra well definitely talk well definitely talking one day yes chris danely one quick one sanjay think going chip act impact memory ecosystem general sanjay mehrotra think say chipset impact yes oh chip act see okay respect chip act definitely first really great government recognizing importance semiconductor important semiconductor national economic consideration well national security consideration course semiconductor important global economy today certainly look forward greater support leadership semiconductor research well semiconductor manufacturing year come course player semiconductor memory semiconductor storage industry well engaged government know government also recognizes importance memory storage strategic part semiconductor industry really look forward opportunity term addressing future need continue stay engaged stay engaged government global site major operation look forward opportunity well really glad funding crossed finish line senate certainly hope house well pas industry get business really strengthening leadership research manufacturing semiconductor year come definitely remain always committed growing supply line industry demand remain disciplined regard operator next question come toshiya hari goldman sachs toshiya hari hi guy thanks lot taking question one dram one nand dram side wanted ask ability grow bit next call four six quarter think dave couple conference talked bit flattish august quarter given transition given low inventory progress sort transition point expect bit supply accelerate dram business extent cant meet demand call next couple quarter think willingness increase capacity dram nand side high level think sanjay feel like feel like sound little bit better nand le cautious nand curious whats changed past couple quarter purely demand better sort shortage around controller yield higher layer count node curious whats changed nand past couple month couple quarter thank dave zinsner okay ill take dram question first think would model sure thinking pretty modest sequential growth fourth quarter term dram think carry first fiscal quarter quite honestly would expect relatively gradual increase ramp wouldnt necessarily inflection point see big growth rate weve focused balance perspective investing mind question almost say thing look dram actually invest dram nand take view term growth rate dram nand sanjay mentioned think dram growth rate dram growth rate mid think nand growing grow around long term thats invest capex always thing might little different investing long run grow supply relationship demand growth deviated strategy sanjay mehrotra nand front yes noted increased outlook term nand industry growth prior discussion nand industry somewhat oversupply seen nand certainly stabilized trend improved fact talked price increase experienced nand well guided price increase nand well overall see tightness nand well remainder calendar year nand demand driven elasticity certainly continuing strength pc also data center smartphone market well overall outlook changed supply inventory believe healthier certainly inventory nand also running lean

large customer supportive consideration environment extremely tight supply flexibility available customer switch product also becoming limited require customer longer well operator thank next question come john pitzer credit suisse line open john pitzer yes sanjay dave thanks let ask question congratulation strong result sanjay sticking capex side characterizing dram market severe shortage nand market stabilizing sort uptick characterized market last couple quarter growing industry bid got sort cost position especially dram yet look capex versus spent fiscal going year get little bit aggressive capex would need see level maintain goal line industry bit share capex level sanjay mehrotra think important understand remain disciplined respect capex want make sure manage prudently goal term supply growth cagr aligned industry demand growth cagr made prudent decision course last year term capex investment look fiscal year capex approximately billion really almost highest capex company spent history putting positioning u well future term course creating cleanroom expansion also investing leading edge technology look ahead drive supply growth node dram well nand node even last year industry going trough period actually took step invest building future strength company believe bit share industry would stay stable overall good environment u operate demand growth supply growth cagr base aligned yes variation important thing supply growth cagr managed disciplined fashion focus believe said deliver stellar result course next several quarter operator thank next question come timothy arcuri ubs line open timothy arcuri thanks lot guess also question capex dave given guiding back half year going basically exiting year like annualizing roughly billion capex something like requires pretty big ramp get like capital intensity number next year kind talking still right number think get like low capital intensity fiscal lot slot get right even decide want spend money tool shipment slot even really free start next year thanks dave zinsner right yes mean keep mind capex little lumpy time need make investment ahead node transition though sometimes get consolidated couple quarter think essentially seeing fiscal ready talk number fiscal yet finished fiscal need kind formulate plan would tell feel comfortable target capex spend low revenue term capex sanjay talked take view capex align capex investment make sure supply demand balance u continue approach way operator thank next question come joe moore morgan stanley question please joe moore great thank look sort bit growth dram given last four quarter get plus type growth february versus supply sort talking le think obviously deceleration implied unwound inventory little bit february know talked little bit maybe give u little bit color got bit growth affect next couple quarter sanjay mehrotra course look last year said supply growth somewhat greater last year compared industry supply growth industry demand growth well positioned u well term using power inventory year supply growth year expected le industry demand growth industry demand growth raised estimation approximately calendar year supply growth somewhat le industry course used dram inventory supply meet growing customer requirement look ahead supply growth driven technology dram ramping course next quarter workhorse technology u term bit growth fiscal well course bring product technology node get qualified customer focused term getting ramp technology technology getting product qualified time position u drive supply bit growth meet ultimate customer demand growth requirement rest calendar year joe moore okay make sense right thinking implied kind decline kind sequential bit moved lot inventory february inventory move may sanjay mehrotra inventory dram really lean point going forward growth come node think important fluctuation really stable market share driven technology transition focus delivered successfully whether look node dram first node industry node first node industry well technology transition focused term driving demand supply bit growth cagr line demand growth cagr depending upon timing technology transition fluctuation term growth lower yes joe moore great thank operator thank next question come chris danely citi line open chris danely hey thanks guy bit question thing continue strong hopefully several quarter like guy talking cash pile going go fairly substantially theoretically speaking sitting year year half thinking far usage cash going forward could see dividend potentially future dave zinsner yes well current obviously approach towards returning cash shareholder buyback mentioned second fiscal quarter buy back stock buy back stock first quarter really function fact cash flow negative protecting cash net cash position say suggest talked expect good cash flow back half fiscal year expect business generate good free cash flow time think primarily look u buy back stock going return least free cash flow form buyback past returned potentially could future thing balance sheet relates convert debt might use cash well far dividend talked board certainly possibility think need get year discus board make sense chris danely great thanks guy dave zinsner sure operator thank next question come toshiya hari goldman sachs line open toshiya hari great thank taking question dave guiding gross margin basis point sequentially may quarter talked exit xpoint driving lower depreciation think million also talked dram cost potentially due fx drought taiwan outside two item thinking cost nand business given transition second gen replacement gate thought pricing dram nand think dram u expecting pricing increase nand side perhaps low guy thinking pricing thinking sustainability pricing thank dave zinsner okay thanks point get million tailwind third fiscal quarter due stoppage depreciation expense lehi certainly beneficial help following quarter actually may little bit better tailwind fourth fiscal quarter talked dram cost affected thing mentioned drought mitigation causing little bit headwind cost dram significant tightness supply chain seeing increased spending relates back end certainly factor well also mentioned prepared remark fx bit headwind u particular taiwan dollar ahead appreciation year thing driving little bit cost increase would say probably kind one two quarter type effect pretty excited node great cost structure workhorse node u fiscal would expect certainly help cost side dram nand front expecting cost improve next quarter

guess couple part first term cost within november quarter assuming dram nand speak also speak mix shift quarter fiscal thinking type cost down across dram nand think plus percent sustainable dram similar type number higher nand think thank dave zinsner okay let start outlook would say cost decline november quarter going pretty minimal obviously getting benefit node node nand running cost headwind relates back end mostly function pandemic disruption caused supply chain forth actually nand dram comment quite honestly specific direction either way dram nand relates mixing range go couple different way obviously could little bit mix shift dram nand could impact gross margin end also business unit could see mix shift within business unit could impact margin well even product level hard call within couple basis point gave range mentioned prepared remark pretty similar range gave back gave prior quarter roughly seeing thing pretty similar saw fourth fiscal quarter agree great gross margin pretty happy operating margin generates expecting something similar first fiscal quarter think executing well profitability side business fiscal expect really good cost decline side dram nand function dram nand look kind cost decline dram see percent cost decline industry think perspective dram better next year nand front see cost decline time think next year drive cost decline range next year well obviously likely cost headwind relates pandemic supply challenge thing might impact u first couple quarter hopefully time start go away start see benefit also made lot investment improve cost structure think get behind get behind u say relates pandemic start experience lot cost benefit put place back end well also note look cost structure today looking next year way year think cost reduction seeing competitive industry cost headwind seeing similar cost headwind others within industry memory also across entire space seeing think set u sanjay mentioned good profitability next year think pretty much cover muse thank latif masud thank next question come shannon cross cross research line open shannon cross thank much first question regard pricing talk pricing dynamic especially pullback demand pc vendor expecting see aggressive move competitor although given comment gross margin guessing answer maybe second question regard pc oem partner tracking confidence going actually see demand come second half year get lot question people double ordering even end customer wondering changed methodology tracking partner seeing providing guidance lookout thank sanjay mehrotra respect pricing provide comment pricing look course reported dram nand pricing increased right note gross margin guidance strong fact dave earlier pointed guidance time june call look fiscal year projecting record year company solid profitability full year well remember pricing always function mix overall well respect question around pc mentioned pc customer impacted semiconductor shortage

purely transition dave zinsner forget transition adding wafer see foreseeable future adding wafer either dram nand next year might adding wafer dram sanjay mentioned nand think continue transition support growth toshiya hari thank latif masud thank next question come aaron rakers well fargo question please aaron rakers yeah thanks taking question wanted ask little bit end demand dynamic particularly around data center curious move forward thinking bit demand profile data center server market seeing far kind progression memory compute ratio move forward cpu curious rolling forward expectation next year growth profile bit perspective sanjay mehrotra within data center dram nand demand trend would strong fact data center today become largest market dram nand continue grow faster average industry nand dram foreseeable future well really driven trend ai driving greater need memory addressing workload bom going memory storage part bom server data center going year ago around going year time frame well new architecture new processor enabling core core mean memory attached per core therefore greater gigabyte per server dram well nand transition occurring towards course next couple year well new cpu get launched production higher bandwidth solution course enable value higher performance application adoption going course year course cxl hbm solution also continuing grow data center space average content per server dram ssd also growing cagr basis application strong opportunity ahead well placed respect product portfolio term ssds displacing hdds term u providing higher density memory module server data center application cloud get bigger data center market get bigger u area focused continue focus expanding product portfolio particularly side data center ssds look strong growth opportunity industry well value memory storage solution providing space really critical service cloud customer providing keep mind enterprise well grows slower rate compared cloud seeing resurgence enterprise application well driving overall healthy demand trend data center calendar year fiscal year well beyond aaron rakers quick dave curious start last quarter implement share repurchase think liquidity balance sheet managing company perspective versus continuing learn share repurchase much cash need operationally comfortably run company dave zinsner roughly holding percent revenue term liquidity billion liquidity unused revolver cash obviously le obviously liquidity need course good opportunity relates buyback mentioned also going receive million sale lehi fab also

execution sanjay characterizing current environment relatively supposed read go february quarter business might normally buck normal seasonal headwind guess importantly upturn date memory cycle different prior memory cycle typically eight quarter unabated asp growth margin expansion least plateaued year three quarter different cycle guess make confident pause something sanjay mehrotra respect comment clear mentioning respect pc part market customer customer pc market experienced semiconductor shortage impacting decision purchase memory mentioning demand pc still strong lot unmet demand actually stretch demand time make demand longer stronger longer comment regarding adjusting next month related pc part market outside market discussed earlier see strong demand trend strong demand trend course supply chain shortage experienced pc also experienced part market well customer whereby course different customer handing overall different fashion underlying demand trend driven ai data center intelligent edge user device strong circular nature covid accelerated supply chain shortage stretching demand demand get pushed said making demand growth driver actually stronger longer well call demand referring demand side thing overall strong supply chain aspect course something lead time semiconductor long take several quarter continue improve part semiconductor supply chain already seen improvement expectation continue improve well course coming quarter also keep mind industry memory industry course last couple year stepped inventory ship beyond supply growth phenomenon occurred across industry certainly seeing brought inventory leanest level many year fact target inventory level something common supplier memory industry look ahead supply growth meet customer requirement also replenish inventory taken low level inventory replenished order make sure able service customer meet demand requirement change factor well lean level inventory supplier well need replenish inventory drive healthy balance calendar year frame well yes term supply chain shortage experienced customer expect addressed course time shortage ecosystem may take frame end maybe

main thing really around pc demand impacted overall look guidance take account aspect seasonality well guidance midpoint higher quarter last year inventory capability also overall impacting ability customer term ship john pitzer perfect thank latif masud thank last question come line timothy arcuri ubs line open timothy arcuri thanks lot appreciate dave guess question gross margin wanted go back question asked earlier basis point guidance would like deep percent revenue quarter nand sound like modestly dram nand sound like delta probably pricing would think dram side somebody asked cost said well cost coming much guess trying figure gross margin good going back mixed comment made asp quarter seems like sustainable trend maybe people missing wondering flip u next dave zinsner yes sure tim cost decline going relatively muted remember mix change might impact gross margin bring somewhere within range gave obviously rest function pricing infer ca pricing obviously mix predominant factor driving gross margin pricing cost major factor driving gross margin maybe best way say timothy arcuri got okay guess last thing cost curve reached said youre reached production crossover much like lag effect term really start bend cost curve favorable direction given production crossover thing thanks dave zinsner well clear hit crossover hit end year way benefiting u cost perspective hard see may much getting little bit impacted obviously back end impacting cost decline next year anticipate drive good cost reduction u side good good note u term cost structure think see perspective every

china point overall cloud trend continue healthy term end demand sumit want add comment channel customer term inventory sumit sadana yes mean think inventory level sanjay said higher cloud customer side generally data center side compared channel business cloud side relatively better place compared consumer business challenge sanjay highlighted course different customer different strategy manage particular inventory smaller customer channel focus data center product challenge getting hand product shortage like nic card complete server build smaller customer getting impacted bigger customer sanjay mehrotra harlan ill tell work closely customer mean team sumit mean really engage closely customer across ecosystem partner china well worldwide course keeping close tab business environment evolving operator next question come muse evercore muse guess first question speak magnitude correction dram nand see playing im assuming much larger impact dram side thinking maybe bit kind low teen right way think sanjay mehrotra certainly term inventory adjustment primarily happening smartphone pc market course inventory adjustment happening nand well dram clearly said term overall demand projection year definitely see dram guidance provided earlier well longer term cagr dram high teen see trajectory term nand thing earlier said cagr high see calendar year coming adjustment happening respect inventory smartphone pc market keep mind compared earlier year estimation pc growth projecting pc calendar year nearly similarly smartphone start year expected grow digit term total unit sale worldwide one looking decline digit swing smartphones well translate unit amount like million unit reduction versus expectation earlier year smartphone similarly pc let say million kind reduction term total unit versus projection earlier year course pc smartphone combined represent half memory storage worldwide demand term bit right adjustment primarily happening second half year two market clearly resulting change versus prior expectation dram well nand demand growth muse helpful mark talked wfe trending lower fiscal give idea magnitude think overall capex trending fiscal mark murphy yes mentioned prepared remark expect end fiscal around billion total capex would uptick thats consistent previous statement bit supply growth assumption coming versus previous group view actively working bring spend say confident sit today wfe spend fiscal also evaluating construction large area spend looking reduce utilization older node maintain supply drive capex use shift production node number thing market dynamic real time im going size reduction next year point still moving point confident wfe decline operator next question come krish sankar cowen company krish sankar two quick one first one sanjay sumit kind different way asking cloud question mentioned mobile pc slow seems like data center next year drop yet seem optimistic data center remain strong second half also said cloud inventory high seems like consumer spending slows data center capex drift love hear thought think overall cloud trend one drop second half year quick question maybe mark impact china shanghai lockdown way quantify may quarter mean second half output sanjay mehrotra earlier provided color regarding view cloud think ask sumit add color sumit maybe take china question well sumit sadana yes sure krish quick cloud discussion sanjay mentioned capex trend customer cloud space continue pretty strong end demand cloud service growth cloud service continues robust course like also pointed mean inventory level higher compared remains seen macroeconomic environment going cause cloud spending trend modulate time anything think cloud spending trend going pretty secular pretty strong even kind impact come back strongly thing stabilize even company focus tightening belt macroeconomic environment continue look way become efficient become profitable improve competitive positioning mean extracting value data digitization trend continue kind thing feel going well sustained environment may happen course lot depends macroeconomic environment evolves thats staying close customer switching china question china pretty significant impact trajectory time last quarter contemplating trajectory compared latest guidance provided view china revenue come approximately reduction china revenue caused roughly reduction consolidated revenue thats impact pretty substantial china impact largely driven course smartphone weakness pc weakness general consumer environment weak due covid shutdown percolated different part economy economic environment weak feel like given weakness economy know china tend provide stimulus improve financial economic condition hopeful kind stimulus improvement economy forthcoming quarter ahead timing play issue china unclear remain optimistic time consumer demand come back improve thing operator next question come timothy arcuri ubs timothy arcuri guess two question first one mark buyback quarter great guess say youre going buy back august guess bigger picture question around sort opportunity stock leadership term technology would willing take cash balance take advantage price weakness mean sort minimum cash balance think could sort opportunistically buy back fairly significant piece company mark murphy yes tim im going comment definitively rate pace point balance sheet stronger ever think whats important great position sustain investment market bit softer weve got billion liquidity point billion thats cash liquidity target set point leverage low gross net cash position maturity average debt maturity great shape think want maintain balance sheet able focus long term business point return historically high level shareholder third quarter

quarter timothy arcuri cool thanks guess second question also mark guidance assume inventory august sort think sort balance holding inventory believe data center stay strong sort think inventory august sort bigger picture strategy around keeping inventory bet cloud remain strong mark murphy good question tim heard sanjay talk briefly prepared remark strategy manage supply inventory buffer talk reducing bit supply growth assumption bit starting sort softer period pretty good place ended third quarter billion inventory day day expect inventory go quarter build flexibility work optimize price product want note inventory much built leading node competitive long time well also use inventory build revisit capex decision defer capex optimize manufacturing footprint cjs earlier question give u confidence lower wfe spend next year expect go couple week day fourth quarter well see market develops way move complex wafer processing complex module product sort adding pressure day also offsetting better cycle time lower stock level forth think day would uncomfortable number weve talked past around day start thats high level would definitely go fourth quarter well see inventory level go operator next question come vivek arya bank america vivek arya sanjay im curious think outlook bottom cycle think risk extend mentioned consumer headwind could continue play second half calendar year also cloud inventory elevated level guess specific question much realize dont guide quarter think sale margin likely flat sequentially sanjay mehrotra clearly dont guide pointed prepared remark expect inventory adjustment working course second half year pointed inventory adjustment primarily taking place pc smartphone market ill point past history well inventory adjustment begin certain part segment take couple quarter work course macroeconomic uncertainty well rapidly changing uncertain environment keep mind look normally see return term demand thats like mark pointed response last question using inventory address demand next year continue closely customer understand overall demand environment think sometime fiscal fiscal demand rebound importantly really balance respect balance see taking action immediately term curtailing supply growth fiscal year sharing plan bringing capex versus estimation earlier thats important step course industry shown dram capex discipline well believe action also contribute toward returning industry health sooner would expect sometime fiscal year demand rebound well industry demand supply environment there store healthy level point look highly uncertain rapidly changing environment course responding fast term change see pointing specific quarter time think whats also important execution continues really strong mean whether look

srivastava got mark real quick one wfe versus whats percentage respect fact plan still flux cant give u number whats number expected year please thank mark murphy im sorry ambrish couldnt hear question ambrish srivastava sorry question whats wafer front end versus front end spend capex year mark murphy okay got mix spend wont give exact number mix varies depends product cycle availability fab space facility factor half capex generally manufacturing wfe half split development capex construction ambrish srivastava say could take construction well mean construction well development whats right way think kind playbook everybody looking thing continue mark murphy specific talking wfe manufacturing thats addressing would go commit going construction technology development say though depending market play inventory level supply bit growth forth continue look footprint thats continuous process optimize amount spend make sure thats clear wfe half rest construction spend equipment
